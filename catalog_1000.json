The construction of the square and colonnade was an undertaking of immense proportions and complexity. In transforming the small existing piazza, Bernini was expected to cater for several functions. First, he had to provide a suitable space for the throngs who assemble for the papal blessing delivered from the Benediction Loggia above the main portal of the façade. He had to allow a view of the window in the Vatican Palace on the north side of the square from which the pope gives his Sunday blessing. It was also necessary to create a monumental, dignified approach to St Peter's, one that expressed its special status as the primary church of Christendom. On a more practical level, passageways protected from the elements were required for ceremonial processions as well as for pedestrian and coach traffic.\r\nBernini's solution was to regularize the narrow, sloping space immediately in front of the church and to demolish the medieval and Renaissance buildings impinging upon the planned site. He laid out a vast oval area, its long axis parallel to the façade of the basilica and with the great obelisk erected by Sixtus V at the centre. This space was defined and framed by two immense, curved, free-standing colonnades, each composed of four rows of Doric columns. Viewed from the square, these lines of massive columns produce a powerful sculptural effect capped by the legions of travertine saints populating the balustrade and silhouetted against the sky.\r\nThis architectural complex creates a ceremonial space of the utmost grandeur. Moreover, the purposely low profile of the colonnade arms, their heavy proportions and linkage to the outer edge of St Peter's stressed the vertical thrust of Maderno's façade with its lighter Corinthian columns and so helped to diminish the sense of excessive width caused by the addition of two bays as foundations for the unrealized bell-towers.\r\nIn his original plan for the square Bernini envisaged a third, free-standing section of colonnade, at the now open end of the piazza, to close off the arms and to screen the visitor's view upon his approach. This arm was never built, and the broad avenue created in 1937 with its vista towards the Tiber distorts Bernini's intention that the colonnades should 'embrace Catholics to reinforce their belief, heretics to reunite them with the Church, and agnostics to enlighten them with true faith'.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1667,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"St. Peter's Square, Rome","name":"General view","start_year":1656,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/b/bernini/gianlore/architec/st_peter.jpg"},{"artworkid":8,"author":"DEGAS, Edgar","description":"\r\nThe painting shows the star of the show dancing a solo turn on an empty stage.

He gradually produced a wider range of works, painting history pictures and landscapes, and was also active as a dealer, printmaker and enthusiastic collector. It is, above all, for his collection rather than his paintings that he is now best known; it is housed in the Musée Fabre in his native Montpellier and includes a number of important sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italian paintings, as well as a wide selection of the artist's own work.\r\nFabre returned briefly to Paris (1809-10) and this intense and sensitive portrait of a fashionably dressed young man is dated to the first year of this visit.

So profoundly could he pursue the smallest change in the animal's appearance that he had no need to take an inventory of its limbs, nor to regard the position of its head as a symbol of its body. All we can see represents the whole animal most expressively. This, of course, demands a very high and sophisticated level of draughtsmanship. Pisanello conveyed the animals' contours and interpreted the different shapes, masses and delicate effects of the surfaces by changing thickness of a single line, or by lines drawn closely side by side with a sure hand and an unbroken, enclosed line.\r\nIt is well worth noticing that even if it was only a sheet of studies the artist paid marked attention to the harmony of the composition.

His own version of the Diana and Callisto story of c. 1639, for example,  clearly draws directly on his close study of Titian's Diana pictures when he visited the court of Madrid in 1628-29.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1639,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 202 x 323 cm","museum_name":"Museo del Prado, Madrid","name":"Diana and Callisto","start_year":1639,"type":"mythological","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/r/rubens/23mythol/58mythol.jpg"},{"artworkid":50,"author":"QUARTI, Eugenio","description":"\r\nThis furniture is a sofa base in walnut with an opening seat inlaid with horn and pewter, embossed copper applications.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1894,"genre":"furniture","materials":"Walnut inlaid with horn and pewter","museum_name":"Private collection","name":"Sofa base","start_year":1894,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/q/quarti/sofabase.jpg"},{"artworkid":942,"author":"POELAERT, Joseph","description":"\r\nIn 1860 Poelaert became a member of the commission overseeing the competition for a new Palais de Justice, Brussels. None of the 28 designs submitted was awarded a prize; instead, a proposal made by Poelaert in 1862 was approved by the Minister of Justice, to whom he insisted on being personally and solely responsible for the execution of the building. He effectively ceased all other professional activities to concentrate on this project (built 1866-83), which was intended to comprise a structure of 20,000 sq. m costing three million Belgian francs but which ended up nearly 30% larger and costing some 50 million francs.\r\nThe gigantic scale and conspicuous site of the Palais de Justice - Poelaert's masterpiece - made him the best-known Belgian architect of the mid-19th century. The structure rises in a series of heavy colonnaded masses to a high cupola; it terminates the prestigious Rue de la Régence in Brussels, overlooks its working-class core and visually dominates the entire city. The building's political promoters conceived it as a monument that, by virtue of its size and position as well as its classicizing style and sculptural programme, would dramatize the triumph of secularism over the religious traditions embodied in the various Gothic and Gothic Revival monuments of the city.\r\nThe success of the building was due wholly to the crushing iconographic power of its shape and dramatic interior spaces. Its academicist plan, with multiple axes of long, often redundant corridors and staircases outlining immense empty volumes on many levels, proved almost dysfunctional. Sometimes categorized as Baroque Revival, the Palais de Justice is really an eclectic composition, with Néo-Grec, Neo-classical and Renaissance Revival elements disposed with great originality and always with an eye to scenographic rather than architectonic effect.\r\nThe photo shows the main façade.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1883,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Palace of Justice, Brussels","name":"Exterior view","start_year":1866,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/p/poelaert/justice3.jpg"},{"artworkid":15,"author":"PCHEUX, Laurent","description":"\r\nIn 1765 Laurent Pécheux was called to Parma to paint Princess Maria Luisa (1751–1819) who, although only thirteen, was already renowned for being spoiled and conceited.

The original medieval citadel (c. 1100-c. 1400) was almost completely destroyed in 1552 during the second Margrave war; only the 14th-century donjon survived. The new castle was built on the same site, and derived its name from the citadel chapel of St John the Baptist. In 1605 Johann Schweikart von Kronberg, Archbishop and Elector of Mainz (reg 1604-26), summoned Georg Riedinger to Aschaffenburg to plan and supervise the castle reconstruction. Work began in February 1614 and was completed nine years later at the enormous cost of one million guilders.\r\nRiedinger's scheme consists of four long ranges, each 51 m in length and three storeys high to the eaves, disposed around a square inner courtyard. In planning Schloss Johannisburg, Riedinger used as his basis the main dimensions of the medieval donjon, which he incorporated in the north range of his new building as a symbol of tradition and the continuity of power and dominion exercised by the prince-bishops.\r\nThe four corner towers on the exterior of Schloss Johannisburg have eight storeys and are 52 m high; the smaller stair-towers on the interior of the corners have four storeys and rise above a square ground floor into an octagon. With the exception of the stuccoed walls of the donjon, the elevations are faced in uniform courses of red sandstone ashlar. The quoins of the corps de logis are emphasized by diamond faceting. The three storeys, treated almost identically, are articulated horizontally by powerful string courses that also run round the towers, and vertically by axially located windows that have distinctive jambs and are capped by pediments that vary according to floor. Apart from the northern range with its towering donjon, the other three façades are richly ornamented, displaying decorative forms of the German Renaissance as well as Italian influences.\r\nIn the late 16th and early 17th centuries, influenced by French and Italian architectural theory, several other buildings with a similar plan were built in south-western Germany, especially in the Roman Catholic territories.\r\nSchloss Johannisburg was severely damaged in World War II, but between 1954 and 1964 the exterior and chapel were restored following the 17th-century model.\r\nThe photo shows the inner courtyard.\r\nView the ground plan of the castle.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1623,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Schloss Johannisburg, Aschaffenburg","name":"General view","start_year":1614,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/r/riedinge/aschaff3.jpg"},{"artworkid":71,"author":"CANOVA, Antonio","description":"\r\nTwo plaster reliefs in the Museo Correr, Teach the Ignorant and Feed the Hungry, are the originals of subjects often repeated by Canova and his assistants.The great sculptor here displays his nobility of line, serenity and complete mastery of space and light.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1796,"genre":"sculpture","materials":"Plaster, 115 x 127 cm","museum_name":"Museo Correr, Venice","name":"Feed the Hungry","start_year":1795,"type":"mythological","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/c/canova/1/51feed.jpg"},{"artworkid":75,"author":"UCCELLO, Paolo","description":"\r\nThe story of the Miracle of the Desecrated Host is told through the following six episodes:\r\n(1) a woman sells the Host to a Jewish merchant;\r\n(2) when the merchant tries to burn it, the Host begins to bleed;\r\n(3) religious procession to reconsecrate the Host;\r\n(4) the woman is punished and an angel descends from heaven;\r\n(5) the Jewish merchant and his family are burnt at the stake;\r\n(6) two angels and two devils fight over the woman's body.\r\nThe panels give us evidence of the artist's narrative ability, enhanced by lively colours and a charming fairytale mood.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1469,"genre":"painting","materials":"Panel, 43 x 58 cm","museum_name":"Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, Urbino","name":"Miracle of the Desecrated Host (Scene 1)","start_year":1465,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/u/uccello/5miracle/miracle1.jpg"},{"artworkid":79,"author":"UNKNOWN MASTER, Netherlandish","description":"\r\nThese wings are the outside shutters of an altarpiece.

Agata in Lendinara. It must originally have been rounded at the top, for it appears in this form in an etching by Tiepolo's son, Giovanni Domenico. The part which is now missing showed a heart surrounded by the crown of thorns in a nimbus, at which the saint was gazing. The beautiful Agatha was a devout Christian who lived in Catania. She steadfastly refused to make sacrifice to the heathen gods. When she defied the threats of the Roman Governor of Sicily, Quintianus, he ordered her breasts to be cut off. We see her, half-naked, on a flight of steps; a maid kneels behind her, supporting her and holding her dress against the bleeding wounds. A page stands in front of a marble pillar, holding the severed breasts of the martyr on a silver platter and gazing down at her. The uncouth figure of the executioner, clad in red and holding a blood-stained sword, towers menacingly over the group.\r\nTiepolo is among the last of the great Venetian painters, a master of large-scale composition, who was commissioned by princes outside (Würzburg, Madrid) as well as inside Italy. Nor did he shrink from this particularly horrifying subject; once before, twenty years earlier, he had been required to treat the same subject for the church of S. Antonio in Padua. With astonishing self-assurance the painter succeeds in portraying this fearful episode in artistic terms without allowing it to degenerate into mere bloodshed and horror. At the same time, so strong is his desire for realism - and he had doubtless witnessed executions himself - that he exploits to the utmost the artistic possibilities open to him.\r\nIn colour and form the composition is extremely accomplished, almost too much so to do justice to the theme. Between the soaring pillar and the towering figure of the executioner, one glimpses the dark entrance of the dungeon and beneath it the pale face of the martyr, flanked on both sides - almost oppressively close - by the faces of the two witnesses. The compassion expressed in the attitude of the young woman on the right contrasts with the searching glance of the page on the left, in which merely the physical effect of the scene before him is reflected. The wide, pale-blue cloak of the saint serves to bind the group of three figures together and blends with the silver-white, the bright yellow and the orange to produce a colour-harmony that is characteristic of Tiepolo. Two of the artist's crayon studies for the saint's face are in the Kupferstichkabinett (Copper Engravings section) in the Berlin Museum.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1756,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 184 x 131 cm","museum_name":"Staatliche Museen, Berlin","name":"The Martyrdom of St Agatha","start_year":1756,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/7_1760s/07agatha.jpg"},{"artworkid":92,"author":"ALGARDI, Alessandro","description":"\r\nThe Franzone family acquired a chapel, the Cappella del Crocefisso, in the Carmelite church of San Carlo (now Santi Vittore e Carlo) in Genoa.

Among the apparently random accumulation of objects were clocks, snuffed-out candles, faded flowers and skulls, reminders of the passage of time and the inevitability of death and decay. As the century progressed these elements dropped away and still-lifes became simply displays of the rare, exotic, expensive and beautiful.\r\nJan van Huysum, whose career spanned the first half of the eighteenth century, was the heir to this great tradition of still-life painting and, as far as floral still lifes are concerned, its greatest exponent.

Built between 1590 and 1597 for the formidable Bess of Hardwick, it was designed by the architect Robert Smythson, an exponent of the Renaissance style of architecture. Hardwick Hall is one of the earliest examples of the English interpretation of this style, which came into fashion having slowly spread from Florence. Its arrival in Britain coincided with the period when it was no longer necessary or legal to fortify a domestic dwelling.\r\nBess of Hardwick (c. 1527-1608) was the richest woman in England after Queen Elizabeth I, and her house was conceived to be a conspicuous statement of her wealth and power. The windows are exceptionally large and numerous at a time when glass was a luxury. The Hall's chimneys are built into the internal walls of the structure, in order to give more scope for huge windows without weakening the exterior walls.\r\nHardwick Hall was the culmination of Smythson's first stylistic phase, even though his responsibility for the house must have been less comprehensive than at Wollaton. The plan of Hardwick is clearly derived from that of Worksop Manor, but the forms are simpler: a rectangular block with six projecting towers that rise above the main roof. Externally the detail is pared to a minimum, and the uncompromising severity of the great windows makes them very reminiscent of Perpendicular Gothic fenestration. These windows increase in height towards the top of the house, expressing the disposition of the great rooms, the high great chamber and the gallery, on the second floor.\r\nThe ingenuity of the planning, particularly of the two meandering staircases contrived behind symmetrical façades, is characteristic of Smythson, while the position of the hall, placed across the house and entered axially at one end, may also have been suggested by him. This marks an advance over Wollaton but was not to be maintained in subsequent houses. With the possible exceptions of chimney-pieces derived from Serlio and Vredeman de Vries, the architectural decoration is unlikely to be of Smythson's choosing, for he did not oversee the building work.\r\nView the floor plans of Hardwick Hall.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1597,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire","name":"Aerial view","start_year":1590,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/s/smythson/3hardwi3.jpg"},{"artworkid":130,"author":"GAUGUIN, Paul","description":"\n\n","end_year":1896,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 75 x 65 cm","museum_name":"Ordrupgaardsamlingen, Ordrupgaard","name":"Portrait of a Young Girl, Vat Goupil","start_year":1896,"type":"portrait","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/g/gauguin/06/tahiti58.jpg"},{"artworkid":134,"author":"MAN, Cornelis de","description":"\n\n","end_year":-1,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 74 x 66 cm","museum_name":"Private collection","name":"The Reading Lesson","start_year":-1,"type":"genre","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/m/man/lesson.jpg"},{"artworkid":231,"author":"BRYULLOV, Aleksandr Pavlovich","description":"\r\nThis lithograph is part of a series \"Views of St Petersburg and its Environs\" published by the Society for the Promotion of the Arts from 1821 to 1826.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1822,"genre":"graphics","materials":"Lithograph, 493 x 620 mm","museum_name":"The Hermitage, St. Petersburg","name":"Sennaya Square","start_year":1822,"type":"landscape","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/b/bryullov/aleksand/sennaya.jpg"},{"artworkid":946,"author":"BASILE, Ernesto","description":"\n\n","end_year":1900,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Salita Belmonte, 43, Palermo","name":"Hotel Villa Igiea: view from the garden","start_year":1899,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/b/basile/igiea5.jpg"},{"artworkid":99,"author":"VELDE, Henry van de","description":"\r\nAt the last salon of Les Vingt, in 1893, van de Velde exhibited his tapestry Angels' Vigil, which marks his transition within artistic disciplines.

The only point that can  be established is that the architect was familiar with the treatise of Serlio, since the elevation is largely composed from plates of his book. Whoever the architect may be, however, he must rank with Lescot and Delorme as one of the creators of the classical style of the middle of the century, and his influence seems to have been wide among architects in Toulouse.\r\nThe exact extent of Bachelier's role in the construction of the courtyard is unclear: he seems to have provided only the sculptural decoration (1555–58), while the brick shell was entrusted to the master-mason Jean Castagné.\r\nThe photo shows the courtyard two sides of which have a three-level elevation superimposing the three classical orders (Ionic order, Doric order, Corinthian order); it takes up the hierarchy of orders established by the treatise of Serlio.

He was named Bishop of Tropea in 1540 and cardinal in 1551. From 1549 he was responsible for the continuation of constructing and furbishing the family palace in Bologna.\r\nIn the palace, Poggi had the halls of the piano nobile painted by Niccolò dell'Abate, Prospero Fontana, and others. They painted friezes with landscapes and grotesques, as well as numerous episodes from the Old Testament. In the ground floor, the twenty-three-year-old Pellegrino Tibaldi created the Odysseus frescoes, a major work that he would never again equal, one which even Annibale Carracci would decisively fall back upon as a model at the end of the sixteenth century.\r\nTibaldi's frescoes, depicting the Adventures of Odysseus, were created in 1550-51. Poggi must have been satisfied with the decoration, since shortly thereafter he also commissioned the artist to paint his newly built family chapel in Bologna's San Giacomo Maggiore. Tibaldi adorned the chapel with scenes from the life of Poggi's name saint, John the Baptist.\r\nThe Odysseus frescoes adorn the vaults of two rooms. From the entry corridor of the palace one walks first into a large hall (Sala di Ulisse), where the cycle begins. One finds the continuation and conclusion in a smaller room directly adjoining the hall (Stanza di Ulisse). The ceiling articulation and the arrangement of the paintings in both rooms are oriented along the lines of a famous Roman model, Raphael's Logge in the Vatican Palace. The scenes are inserted as 'quadri riportati' (framed paintings that are seen in a normal perspective and painted into a fresco). Between the fields of the painted histories, illusionistic views open onto colonnades that seem to reach up to the heaven. The framings are executed in stucco.\r\nWith their various decorative systems, each of the two rooms achieves a wholly individual character, one corresponding to its respective size and position.\r\nThe ceiling in the Sala di Ulisse contains five scenes from the Adventures of Odysseus, namely\r\n1.

One group is formed by the twelve marble Apostles of the central section. These show marked similarities with mid-14th-century Lombard sculpture, particularly with works of Bonino da Campione, who was active in Verona. The strongly expressive physiognomy of the Apostles' faces is close to the angels' faces on the tomb (Padua, Eremitani) of Ubertino da Carrara (d 1345) by Andriolo de' Santi of Venice, to such mid-14th-century mosaics in San Marco as those in the baptistery and also to Paolo Veneziano's paintings. This would suggest that this sculptor's roots lay in northern Italy.\r\nThe marble female figures on the lateral sections facing the chapel of San Clemente and the chapel of San Pietro are in a different style. Their similarity to Tuscan sculpture, particularly to the work of artists in the circle of Nino Pisano, is so strong that it would suggest that the sculptor stayed for a considerable time in Tuscany and continued working in the Tuscan style on his return to Venice.\r\nGiven that Pierpaolo was absent from Venice c. 1394 and that Jacobello was absent c. 1397, the figures in the central section, which is dated 1394, can be attributed to Jacobello and the lateral sections, dated 1397, to Pierpaolo.

It was built in the early 14th century and was named for and dedicated to Pietro Angeleri da Morone, a hermit monk from Majella (near Sulmona) who became Pope Celestine V in 1294.\r\nThe interior has three naves, separated by pillars supporting Gothic arches, with nine lateral chapels, plus four on each side of the chancel, and transept. The simple volume of the nave, with its telling interplay of plain arches and plane surfaces, is clearly demarcated. No less clear is its expansion into the richer darkness of the vaulted aisles and of the rectangular vaulted chapels beyond. The single detail that epitomizes the simple, balanced contrasts of the building and contains within itself the essence of the transition from the wall-dominated, planar spaces to the rib-dominated aisles is the fusion of columns and flat piers in the nave arcading.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":-1,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"San Pietro a Majella, Naples","name":"Interior view","start_year":-1,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/zzzarchi/14c/3/2/4naples2.jpg"},{"artworkid":162,"author":"MADERNO, Carlo","description":"\r\nThe façade designed by Maderno, is 115 metres wide and 46 metres high and is built of travertine stone, with a giant order of Corinthian columns and a central pediment rising in front of a tall attic surmounted by thirteen statues: Christ flanked by eleven of the Apostles (except Peter, whose statue is left of the stairs) and John the Baptist.

Nowadays we would hardly be deceived by such a painting technique. At the time, however, it was radically new and people's habits of perception had been formed by less illusionist paintings.

Besides Rubens, these included Abraham Janssens, Cornelis de Vos, Gerard Seghers and Theodoor Rombouts. In addition he often provided the background decor for animal pictures by Frans Snyders and Paul de Vos, with whom he was connected by marriage.\r\nFrom about 1620 Wildens's landscapes were marked by a clearer and at the same time more realistic composition. The viewpoint is lower, and what might be called a classical harmony is apparent in the composition, created by clumps of trees used as structural features. In a few cases, such as the two versions (in Dresden and St. Petersburg) of the Winter Landscape with Hunter and Dogs, monumental an sculpturally accentuated figures also support these well-balanced compositions.

The disciples are sitting at a long table in front of a rear wall that runs parallel to the picture plan. Christ is sitting in the centre, and His favourite disciple John is leaning sadly against Him. To the right of Christ, in the place of honour, is the chief Apostle, Peter. Judas the traitor is the only one to be separated from the others: he is seated in front of the table.\r\nThe earliest example of the Last Supper was painted in 1476 by Ghirlandaio in the abbey of San Michele Arcangelo a Passignano (in Tavernelle Val di Pesa, near Florence). This is strongly influenced by Andrea del Castagno. The Apostles and Christ are sitting together in a room with a flat ceiling that appears to be too low. Judas is sitting opposite Christ on a three-legged stool in front of the laid table. The figures are set back some distance from us, to a depth of three large floor tiles.

His white shirt is open at the front, revealing the artist's intention to paint a nude. This figure has the same dimensions in both pictures, which suggests that Caravaggio traced one on to oil-paper. In this case only one picture was completed from a fresh study of a model.\r\nA sort of ribbon woven into the figure's hair emphasizes its almost androgynous features. The same applies - in the New York version - to a broad yoke which divides his shirt under his chest like a woman's dress. This is undoubtedly why Bellori saw this as a female lute-player, although recently it has been suggested that the model was a castrato. Light falls from a high window above left, creating a narrow triangle of brightness in the upper right-hand corner. That said, the brightly illuminated figure stands out boldly against the shadowy background.\r\nThe strongly foreshortened lute with its bent key-board demonstrates Caravaggio's virtuoso handling of perspective. Tactile elements project towards the viewer more successfully than in the New York Concert. As in the Uffizi Bacchus, the artist places a broad table-top in front of the figure - in the St. Petersburg version it is made of marble, and in the New York version covered with an oriental carpet.\r\nThe objects in the picture include an open book of music lying on another which bears the inscription \"Bassus\" in Gothic script, whilst the body of a violin serves to hold the book open at the right page. In both versions Caravaggio has painted the scores of older compositions clearly enough for us to read them. The music in question is the base voice-part of a popular collection, the \"libro primo\" of Jacques Arcadelt, which contains other compositions as well as works by this composer. Although the artist has cut off one row of notes, he has reproduced the initial notes so exactly that in the St. Petersburg example we can recognize the Roman printer, Valerio Dorica, whereas in the second version we can see that the book was published in Venice by Antonio Gardane.\r\nIn the St. Petersburg version, the violin bow lies across the strings and the open book of music - a prominent object for the observation of light and shade. In the New York version it is handled in a much less interesting way. Placed underneath the violin scroll, the bow can scarcely be distinguished from the brownish pattern of the carpet. In this version, a stout recorder and a triangular keyboard instrument are the other objects we see. The X-ray picture shows that they were painted over a still-life. The bird-cage motif in the left-hand corner (barely visible on the photo) shows what unusual motifs Caravaggio liked to select - motifs similar to those preferred by Caravaggesque painters in the Netherlands.\r\nThe St. Petersburg version, on the other hand, plays with the motifs of Caravaggio's other early arrangements of still-life and individual figures. Pieces of fruit lie on the marble slab, extremely brightly colored and brilliantly painted. A crystal vase contains a bunch of flowers, which would have made even Jan Bruegel the Elder jealous. The colors are applied uninhibitedly with a loaded brush - with a richness and precision we do not see elsewhere in Caravaggio's work.\r\n\n\n\r\nSuggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Francesco da Milano: Tre fantasie for lute\n\n\n","end_year":1600,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 102 x 130 cm","museum_name":"Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York","name":"The Lute Player","start_year":1600,"type":"genre","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/c/caravagg/01/091lute.jpg"},{"artworkid":261,"author":"TINTORETTO","description":"\r\nThe central oval canvas on the ceiling of the Sala dell'Albergo is surrounded by 16 allegories of various size.

However, three surviving paintings placed in a chapel consacrated in 1592 - The Jews in the Desert, The Last Supper and The Entombment - were certainly painted by Tintoretto himself.\r\nThe unusual iconography of this painting is still not entirely explained. There is much to suggest that Tintoretto was depicting the Israelites' scorning of the manna that led to the plague of fiery serpents and finally the setting up of the bronze serpent. Or the picture may combine different themes: the camp of the Israelites in the oasis of Elim, the washing of their clothes at the foot of Mount Sinai, the making of the copper basin for the sanctuary, the cooking of the manna, etc. The figure of Moses right foreground, shown in conversation with Aaron, is intentionally made to resemble Christ. Moses forms a typological link with the painting opposite, The Last Supper. As so often in Tintoretto, a certain scriptural meaning is concealed behind details that appear to be merely those of genre painting: the donkey driver top right could be Balaam who beat his animal because it was afraid of the angel of the Lord, whom Balaam himself did not see.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1593,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 377 x 576 cm","museum_name":"San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice","name":"The Jews in the Desert","start_year":1593,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/t/tintoret/5_1580s/2desert.jpg"},{"artworkid":240,"author":"TIEPOLO, Giovanni Battista","description":"\r\nThis painting in the Sala delle Quattro Porte is one of the last public works commissioned by the Venetian Republic.

It cannot have been painted very long after 1435, the year established by dendrochronological dating methods, which would also fit the circumstances of Rogier's life at the time. On the other hand, it must have been painted before 1443, the date of the earliest copy (in the Sint-Pieterskerk, Leuven). \r\nThe Deposition was an altarpiece, intended for the chapel of the Confraternity of the Archers of Leuven, who commissioned it. (The two small crossbows in the lower spandrels of the tracery in the picture refer to the Confraternity.). Mary of Hungary (1505-1558), Regent of the Netherlands, acquired the painting from the Archers of Leuven before 1548. Later it came into the possession of her nephew King Philip II of Spain (1527-1598; king from 1556), who finally placed it in the monastery fortress of the Escorial he had founded near Madrid. At that time the Deposition formed the centre of a triptych, but there is no indication that the side wings were originally part of the work, it is more likely that the Deposition was originally a single panel.\r\nAt about 2.2 meters high and 2.6 meters wide, the painting is very large by the usual standards of Early Netherlandish pictures; in terms of concept it is truly monumental. Ten figures in all cover the painted surface almost entirely, with their heads close to the upper edge of the panel. The body of Jesus has already been removed from the Cross, and is received by two elderly men, the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus. Surrounded by Jesus's mourning friends they are holding His dead body for a moment before setting it down. Mary is sinking to the ground in a faint beside her son, and is supported by John, the favourite disciple of Jesus, and by one of the holy women. On the extreme right, the despairing Mary Magdalene seems on the brink of collapse.\r\nThe scene shown would have lasted for only a moment, but there is nothing momentary about its depiction, which is quite detached from the historical event. Rogier achieves this effect principally by placing the group in a painted niche like an altar shrine; the hill of Golgotha, the Place of Skulls where the Cross stood, is suggested only by skulls and arm bones on the narrow strip of stone floor. A connection is thus established with those gilded shrines holding painted statues that were a particularly costly and lavish form of retable. However, Rogier was not imitating a carved altar. He shows \"live\" figures rather than statues, and the life-like effect is emphasized by their appearance, almost life-size, in the place where mere wooden statues would be expected in an altar. Using such methods, Rogier gives them the three-dimensionality of statues but the look of a painting, which is much more life-like than sculpture.\r\nHowever, such considerations would have played only a minor part in Rogier's decision to set the scene in the painted altar niche. His primary concern was to emphasize the forcefulness of the depiction. Rogier even departs deliberately from what can be rationally imagined, and so breaks with the manner of realistic spatial depiction that had only recently been achieved in painting. The niche he paints is deep enough at the bottom of the picture to accommodate several figures, the upright of the Cross, and the ladder leaning against it; but in some areas at the top it seems to come close to the surface of the picture - the helper on the ladder is pressed tightly into the shallow upper space of the shrine, while the head of the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea just below seems to protrude from the picture. All the figures are brought forward by the golden back wall so that the space surrounds them closely: convincing as their actions may look individually, there would never really have been room for them all. The result is a sense of timelessness and an almost oppressive intensity.\r\nThe painted niche offered Rogier another advantage: he could retain the gold background usual in medieval painting without offending against the demands of naturalistic depiction. The background of the painting is, in fact, a real gilded surface and also a pictorial representation of one - the back of the shrine.\r\nRogier relates the figures to each other in a masterly composition, yet he emphasizes a number of different accents. The limp body of Christ is at the centre, and appears to be held quite naturally by the two men so that it is almost facing the observer, with hardly anything else encroaching on it. This is the part of the picture intended to inspire the greatest reverence, referring to the sacrament in which, in the Catholic faith, the host and the wine become the body and blood of Christ. During divine service the bread and wine would have stood on the altar below this picture, and when the priest raised the host above his head during the ceremony, the congregation would have seen him doing so directly in front of the painted body of Christ.\r\nThe almost radiant body is immaculate and beautiful, undisfigured by the marks of scourging, and its delicate but almost swelling form has a distinctly sensuous softness. Only the marks of the five wounds are ugly gashes running with blood. However, the long trickle from the wound in Christ's side passes over the body like a delicate line that traces the curve of the stomach.\r\nThe other main character in the picture is Mary. The Mother of God, sinking to the ground as if dead, forms a parallel to Christ, allowing the artist to create a link between the two main groups in a bold effect of composition, since they are moving in different directions: Christ is being carried away to the right, while Mary is falling to the left. At the same time, the correspondence between the figures illustrates an important theological idea of the time Mary's own compassionate suffering and her part in Christ's act of redemption. On the right of the picture not directly involved in the action, stands Mary Magdalene. Her magnificent, worldly garments, with the low-necked dress showing her full, sensuous breasts, indicate that she is the \"great sinner\" who has abandoned her depraved way of life and turned to Christ in repentance. In terms of composition, the Magdalene's figure closes off the picture on the right like a large bracket, matching the similarly bowed figure of John on the left. The curve of Mary Magdalene's cloak, sweeping forward into the picture, is echoed by the hem of the brocade robe worn by Nicodemus, and is continued in the left half of the picture by the folds in the Virgin Mary's blue dress. Such overlapping forms and lines determine the structure of the whole picture: the curve of Christ's body is continued in the Magdalene's left arm, and is crossed by the diagonal running in the opposite direction from the eyes of Nicodemus, through the hands of Christ and Mary, to the eye sockets of the skull. Christ's left arm too echoes the movements that seem to curve and turn on each other at the centre of the picture.\r\nThe Deposition is among the outstanding masterpieces of Netherlandish art, and one of the mainstays of Rogier's fame. As the work of a painter aged 35 to 40, it can hardly be described as a youthful production, yet only with this painting can we begin to see Rogier more clearly as an artistic personality. Most important of all, the picture shows unmistakable similarities with some of the major works of the Master of Flémalle.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1435,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on oak panel, 220 x 262 cm","museum_name":"Museo del Prado, Madrid","name":"Deposition","start_year":1435,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/w/weyden/rogier/01deposi/1deposi1.jpg"},{"artworkid":268,"author":"DRER, Albrecht","description":"\r\nDuring his journey to Zeeland, Dürer contracted a malaria-like infection from which he would never recover.

In such a case the painted architectural framing is replaced by a painted or three-dimensional picture frame; Guido Reni's Aurora in the Casino Pallavicini-Rospiglioso is a clear example of this approach. Here the monumentality of the figures, meant to be seen up close, largely eliminates the picture space, which is only suggested as a horizon. In this Reni was following Annibale Carracci, who for the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese invented a complicated, layered framing system with which to make believable the pictures on and in front of the ceiling.

St. Thomas asks a proof from the Virgin for her miraculous assumption. In answer to this request, Mary unfastens and drops her belt to the doubtful apostle. The belt became the most famous Marian relic; it is now a treasure of the Cathedral in Prato.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1430,"genre":"painting","materials":"Tempera on wood, 86 x 51 cm","museum_name":"Christian Museum, Esztergom","name":"Assumption of the Virgin","start_year":1430,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/p/pietro/giovanni/assumpti.jpg"},{"artworkid":288,"author":"FYT, Jan","description":"\n\n","end_year":-1,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas","museum_name":"Private collection","name":"Diana, Goddess of the Hunt (detail)","start_year":-1,"type":"mythological","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/f/fyt/diana_d.jpg"},{"artworkid":292,"author":"MICHELOZZO DI BARTOLOMEO","description":"\r\nThe surviving fragments of the dismembered Aragazzi monument at Montepulciano are almost exclusively the work of Michelozzo.\r\nThe two reliefs that decorated the sarcophagus (still in the church, now Montepulciano Cathedral) are closely based on Roman processional reliefs.

Each element in the picture is perfectly observed from nature; nothing is obviously artificial, but Claude arranged these elements - cabbage-like plants on the ground, classical ruins, a large pine tree - in a way which later generations came to regard as picturesque. To those unfamiliar with the actual landscape he painted, Claude's pictures seem even more artificial than they are. The Roman Campagna has changed little since the seventeenth century, especially the area around Tivoli; the terrain is dotted with the ruins of classical antiquity and there are numerous scattered pine trees which seem, especially when one is walking through them, to take on a `Claudian' aspect when juxtaposed with ruins. The light is marvelously clear, with the sky changing from blue to yellow in the morning and evening. Claude achieved a near perfect depiction of this atmosphere in the Birmingham picture : instead of the brilliant sunshine of the St Ursula there is a soft glow, in which the artist produces an almost milky light. He manages to capture atmosphere not by blurring the edges of each object depicted but by juxtaposing infinitesimal gradations of tone without losing the slightest detail. In all Claude's mature landscapes, and signally in this one, there is a sense of infinite distance in which the spectator can wander at will.\r\nThe painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 90).\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1645,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 74 x 97 cm","museum_name":"City Art Gallery, Birmingham","name":"Landscape with Shepherds - The Pont Molle","start_year":1645,"type":"landscape","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/c/claude/2/02pontmo.jpg"},{"artworkid":282,"author":"SODOMA, Il","description":"\r\nThe painting is signed, inscribed and dated on a cartellino lower right: EX PIETATE/BER.DE SYE/ SODONA EQVES/FACIEBAT SEN/MDXXXIII.

St. Michael's is a landmark of the city and it is considered to be one of the finest Hanseatic Protestant Baroque churches. The church was purposely built Protestant unlike many other Hamburg churches which were originally built by Roman Catholics and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation. It is dedicated to the Archangel Michael.\r\nThe reconstruction of St. Michael's, which had succumbed to fire in 1750, was the main work and masterpiece of Ernst Georg Sonnin. In 1750 he, and the Thuringian-born Johann Leonard Prey (1700-1757) submitted proposals for the reconstruction of the church. The foundation stone was laid a year later, and the finishing ceremony was carried out in December 1757, although with a tower base barely covered over. It was only twenty years later that funds were made available for the construction of the tower.\r\nAlong with the Frauenkirche in Dresden, Sankt Michaelis is considered the most splendid example of a Protestant Baroque church. Protestant in conception but Catholic in execution might be a reasonable description of a first impression on entering the building. The spatial proportions and dimensions of the centralized hall are remarkable, especially when viewed from the gallery. The four piers that mark out the cruciform ground plan support broad coffered transverse arches bearing a lofty trough-shaped vault lined with a broad projecting ledge and an encircling balustrade.\r\nThe composer Johannes Brahms was baptized on May 26, 1833 in this church and confirmed at the age of fifteen.\r\n\n\n\r\nSuggested listening (streaming mp3, 22 minutes):Johannes Brahms: Sonata for cello and piano No. 1 E minor op. 38\n\n\n","end_year":1757,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Sankt Michaelis, Hamburg","name":"Interior view","start_year":1750,"type":"interior","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/s/sonnin/hamburg2.jpg"},{"artworkid":316,"author":"MORETTO da Brescia","description":"\r\nIn this altarpiece, commissioned by the Confraternity of the Holy Cross for their chapel in Brescia Cathedral, Moretto placed the Cross and the pathetic figure of Christ accusingly before the worshipper, the weeping angel in the background demonstrating an appropriately repentant and grieving response.

Botticelli thus not only painted his figures clothed in highly imaginative robes such as present a wealth of variation, but also captured them in the most varied of postures, gestures and facial expressions. The relationship between the various figures here, and between these figures and the action that is taking place, also appears tighter than in the earlier Adoration, nevertheless, they still do not yet constitute a dramatic unity.\r\nThere is such a wealth of figures in this composition that the overall effect can seem quite confusing, but in the centre is the child sitting on Mary's lap.

The layout consists of an enormous square crossing crowned with a hemispherical dome, vast apses to left and right and a square chancel covered by a remarkable umbrella vault and with a further apse beyond.

Trained in Flanders and influenced by his compatriots Rubens and Van Dyck, he gradually rejected the flamboyance of their style for a more severe and naturalistic idiom. The change is particularly noticeable after 1645 when he became sympathetic to the rigorous doctrines of the Dutch Catholic theologian Cornelis Jansen, practised at the Paris convent of Port Royal where Champaigne sent both his daughters to school.\r\nThe sitter for this grandiose portrait, however, is obviously not one of the artist's Jansenist patrons: where they wear sober black, he wears crimson; where they appear against a plain grey background, he stands in a palatial gallery against a great Baroque swathe of curtain, a glimpse of his château gardens behind him. He is Armand-Jean du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu (1585-1642), cardinal, Chief Minister to the King and virtual ruler of France from 1624 until his death. Richelieu consolidated the central powers of the crown and put down the Huguenot rebellion. He created the French merchant navy and effective fighting fleets in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. On land, he challenged the might of the Habsburg Empire. To readers of Alexandre Dumas, he will always be the haughty antagonist and sometime patron of the (four) Three Musketeers - but then, Dumas had Champaigne's portraits of Richelieu on which to base his unforgettable character.\r\nUnable to have himself portrayed as ruler, Richelieu stands in the pose traditionally associated with French monarchs. (It was pointed out how rare it is for a cardinal to be shown standing - 'Like women, they sat'.) Richelieu wears the chivalric Order of the Saint-Esprit, its blue moiré ribbon contrasting with the starched white linen and the crimson satin of his collar and cloak. Instead of a baton or cane, he holds a scarlet biretta in his stiffly extended right hand. This extraordinary object seems to float up to the surface of the canvas in defiance of spatial logic; as it hypnotically draws our glance we become aware of its tacit message. Champaigne has carefully shown its inner lining catching the light, thus drawing attention to our viewpoint from below - an optical fact underscored by the low horizon line beyond. We are gazing upwards at Richelieu, his face the distant apex of an elongated pyramid down which lustrous drapery flows like lava. Although diminished in scale by the distance between us, the face is undistorted by foreshortening like the majestic images of Christ the Ruler in the apses of Byzantine churches. But where these spiritual icons look deep into our eyes, the King's Minister stares haughtily out, allowing us to look at him...as a cat may look at a king.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1637,"genre":"painting","materials":"OiI on canvas, 260 x 178 cm","museum_name":"National Gallery, London","name":"Cardinal Richelieu","start_year":1637,"type":"portrait","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/c/champaig/philippe/richeli.jpg"},{"artworkid":322,"author":"MONET, Claude","description":"\n\n","end_year":1889,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 73 x 70 cm","museum_name":"Muse d'Unterlinden, Colmar","name":"Creuse, Sunset","start_year":1889,"type":"landscape","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/m/monet/07/1vario17.jpg"},{"artworkid":326,"author":"VERONESE, Paolo","description":"\r\nWhen opened, the painted wings of the organ of San Sebastiano show an interior court surrounded by Corinthian colonnades.

Trained as a topographical draughtsman, he achieved his ambition through mastering the idioms of Claude and of the grander Dutch seventeenth-century marine and landscape painters as well as the melodramatic effects of the scene designer Jacques Philippe de Loutherbourg. Now nearly forgotten, this Alsatian-born member of the French Academy delighted the London public, and influenced artists from Gainsborough to Turner and Joseph Wright of Derby, by staging panoramic peepshows in which painted landscapes, theatrical lighting and sound were combined to simulate natural phenomena and tragic catastrophes.\r\nIn search of the Sublime, Turner travelled widely, sketching grandiose scenery and extreme weather conditions, which he translated into canvases exhibited with poetic quotations. He considered Dido building Carthage, or the Rise of the Carthaginian Empire (1815) his masterpiece, bequeathing it together with the Sun rising through Vapour to the National Gallery on condition that they be hung beside Claude's Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba and Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah. (This bequest is now honoured.)\r\nTurner's emulation of Baroque painting, however, did not exclude modern references, rather transmuting them into 'high' art. In this way he competed with both historic and contemporary masters. The 'Fighting Temeraire' was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 with a quotation from Thomas Campbell's poem Ye Manners of England: The flag which braved the battle and the breeze/No longer owns her'. The Temeraire had distinguished herself at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, but by the 1830s the veteran warships of the Napoleonic wars were being replaced by steamships. Turner, on an excursion on the Thames, encountered the old ship, sold out of the service, being towed from Sheerness to Rotherhithe to be scrapped. In his painting topography and shipbuilding alike are manipulated to symbolic and pictorial ends. Turner conceives the scene as a modern Claude: a ghostly Temeraire and the squat black tug, belching fire and soot, against a lurid sunset. His technique is very different from Claude's, as thick impastoed rays and reflections contrast with thinly painted areas, and colours swoop abruptly from light to dark. A heroic and graceful age is passing, a petty age of steam and money bustles to hasten its demise. The dying sun signals the end of the one, a pale reflecting moon the rise of the other. But just as Claude's sunrises and sunsets enlist the viewer's own sense of journey, so does the last berth of the 'Fighting Temeraire' recall the breaking up of every human life.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1839,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 91 x 122 cm","museum_name":"National Gallery, London","name":"The 'Fighting Temeraire' tugged to her Last Berth to be broken up","start_year":1838,"type":"landscape","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/t/turner/2/201turne.jpg"},{"artworkid":329,"author":"SEGNA DI BUONAVENTURE","description":"\r\nThe detail shows the mourning Virgin on the left terminal.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1315,"genre":"painting","materials":"Egg tempera on wood","museum_name":"National Gallery, London","name":"Crucifix (detail)","start_year":1310,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/s/segna/crucifi1.jpg"},{"artworkid":333,"author":"BOUCHER, Franois","description":"\r\nIn Virgil's epic Aeneid, Venus seduces Vulcan and persuades him to forge weapons for her son Aeneas.

Some of them show middle-class sitters, even rarer in art than the depiction of the poor. It is one of these larger 'bourgeois compositions' which admits the Le Nain brothers into that small group of painters capable of creating a masterpiece. This is the Smokers in an Interior in the Louvre, dated 1643. Its technique must have been learned during the painting of the Forge, but the brushwork is far more precise. The composition is much less original, being closer to the type familiar from the Dutch. The figures are grouped round a table illuminated by a solitary candle, and the figure on the left has fallen asleep at the table.\r\nIn this painting it seems that the depiction of low life - here middle-class men smoking in an interior - has risen beyond its normal pictorial limitations to create a masterpiece which is, perforce, unexpected. While Nicolas Poussin was obsessed with the concept of beauty and with the need to be able to paint exactly what he thought, here the painter's desire arises from an opposite need, the need to observe.

Of the Christian sacraments - acts conferring grace - Protestants generally recognize two, Baptism and Communion, and the Catholics seven, which comprise, in addition, Confirmation, Penance (Confession), Extreme Unction, Holy Orders and Matrimony, the last two still being mutually exclusive. They are seen on medieval fonts and as altarpiece cycles in early Netherlandish painting, where the subject seems to have had greater appeal, at least until the 17th century. The triptych of Rogier van der Weyden is a good example of these altarpieces.\r\nWe see an acuteness of observation in the Altar of the Sacraments. The Calvary sequence takes place in the interior of a light, spacious church, whose carefully executed details immediately catch the viewer's eye. The seven sacraments are presented around the central crucifixion group accompanied by an angel with a banderole. The importance of the action in the central panel is emphasised by the size of the depicted personages compared to the figures in the side panels. The emotion of the central characters - Saint John and the three Marys - who are overcome with grief, is a characteristic feature of Van der Weyden's art. It is thought that the triptych was commissioned in 1441 by the Bishop of Tournai, Jean Chevrot, for the altar of his private chapel. Van der Weyden portrays him on the left of the painting, as the bishop administering Confirmation.\r\nVan der Weyden was probably helped by his assistants during the execution of the Altar of the Sacraments.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1450,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on oak panel, 200 x 97 cm (central panel), 119 x 63 cm (side panel, each)","museum_name":"Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp","name":"Seven Sacraments Altarpiece","start_year":1445,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/w/weyden/rogier/05sevens/0sevens.jpg"},{"artworkid":366,"author":"GRECO, El","description":"\r\nThere is an analogous version in the Cathedral of Toledo which is part of a series of the twelve Apostles, called Apostolados.

Bishop Everardus (1121-1145) completed the nave, fourteen bays long, and finished if off with a simple cross-section façade.\r\nThe photo shows a view of the choir towards the east.

However, no books have survived which can be attributed to him. The next royal illuminator whose work is identifiable was Jean Pucelle. He is mentioned in documents between 1319 and 1327, however, books attributable to him (more than a dozen) exist up to the middle years of the century.\r\nThe Belleville Breviary comes from the workshop of Jean Pucelle. Pucelle's style is close to that of Honoré. The drapery has the same soft modelling and in Pucelle's presumed early work faces and hands are delicate and pallid. Nevertheless, a great many new features appear. The page from the Belleville Breviary reveals a wide range of decorative invention embracing naturalistic flowers, insects, birds and animals and grotesque little men playing musical instruments. But the whole effect is tightly controlled, associated as it is with a firm regular framework of narrow bars.\r\nThe influence of Italian painting is marked in Pucelle's work, demonstrated by his interest in pictorial space. This is possibly the most revolutionary feature of his work. The exploitation of various rudimentary forms of perspective was a completely new feature of late thirteenth-century Italian painting, and Pucelle incorporated something of these experiments into his manuscript illuminations.\r\nThe page (folio 24v) from the Belleville Breviary shows David and Saul enclosed within a small doll's-house-like construction, painted erratically but clearly in three dimensions.

Nothing seems to indicate, however, that it belongs to one of a series of paintings symbolizing the seven liberal arts. We have no certain data on its original purpose.\r\nThe painting probably shows the Muse Erato leading a swan by a golden leash. The swan, an attribute of Apollo, may be associated with Musica as well; its symbolic role is based on the fact that it miraculously sang before its death; thus the concept of the swan song.\r\nThere is a lyre of a peculiar form in the painting. Such a fantastic instrument more than likely would have been unsuitable for playing. Its frame is a head of a stag, and the strings are stretched across the cross-bands mounted on the antlers. The painter even placed a piece of bone next to it. The stag has been used by painters to represent Hearing because of its keen ears; thus it may be connected with the concept of music.\r\nIt is proposed that in the form of a winged putto even Zephyrus may have a role in the depiction of music, since the swans sing only when the mild western wind blows, while the musicians require a certain breath of personal glory to inspire them to play. The putti who play with the swan, on the other hand, may belong to a third female figure, Leda. Jupiter, in the form of a swan, seduced her, and their love bore two sets of twins, although in paintings usually only two children are depicted.

The drawing is believed to have been done in Frankenthal, a small town in the Pfalz mountains where an important artists' colony sprang up after the fall of Antwerp to the Spanish in 1585. Many of the artists who settled there were Flemings sympathetic to the Reformation, who had been forced into exile because of their Protestant faith. Some years later, a number of them, including Gillis van Coninxloo, moved to Amsterdam. Protestant artists worked in Frankenthal in a reformed environment, which was naturally reflected in the subjects they chose to paint. That is certainly the case with this drawing. The Prophet Hosea opposed what he saw as abuses in the field of worship, making him a symbolic precursor of early Protestant leaders.\r\nGillis van Coninxloo is viewed as an innovator in Flemish landscape painting. Above all, he represents the transition from the Mannerist to the Baroque landscape. The watercolour of the prophet Hosea is still done entirely in his early Mannerist style. Van Coninxloo went on to master and develop a variety of styles in his life. His influence on his contemporaries was crucial, and was felt by both Flemish and Dutch painters.

It is probably for precisely that reason that he was so popular among the rich Florentines, who were particularly keen on self portrayal. This makes it all the more astonishing that so few secular portraits by Ghirlandaio have survived.\r\nThere are two paintings dating from about 1490, in the Paris Musée du Louvre and in Madrid, that are masterpieces of his art and yet fundamentally different: Giovanna Tornabuoni is idealized to the extent of becoming an \"icon\" of beauty for young Florentine girls, while the old man with the boy is painted with a pitiless degree of realism. Ghirlandaio does not shrink even from depicting his nose in all its disfigurement.\r\nThe painting in Madrid depicts Giovanna degli Albizzi in a magnificent garment made of gold brocade with tight, slitted silk sleeves. She came from one of the most important Florentine families and in 1486 married Lorenzo Tornabuoni. After her early death Ghirlandaio created two portraits, and it is possible that he was able to produce the cartoon for them while she was still alive.\r\nIn a fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel, Giovanna is depicted as an entire figure witnessing the Visitation. The artist used that portrait in his panel painting with a new background, though he unfortunately cut the arms and hands off rather awkwardly. The delightful young woman now stands out, in a clear contrast of light against dark, from the black niche in the background. The reserved beauty of the young woman is fittingly expressed in the formal clarity of the composition.\r\nShe is wearing a valuable piece of jewelry, comprising a ruby in a gold setting with three silky shining pearls, hanging from her neck by a delicate cord. There is a very similar item of jewelry on the shelf behind her, and this, combined with red coral beads against the black background, gives the work a noble elegance. These beads are part of a rosary, and the section that is hanging straight down emphasizes the vertical line of her back, and also directs our gaze to the prayer book. Between these two \"pious\" objects is a little note alluding to the beautiful soul of the portrayed woman by means of an epigram written by the Roman poet Martial in the first century A.D.: Ars utinam mores animumque effigere posses pulchrior in terris nulla tabella foret. (Art, if only you could portray mores and spirit, there would be no more beautiful picture on earth).\r\nThis outstanding portrait, one of the most famous of the Quattrocento, makes it clear that portraits of women were one of Ghirlandaio's ideal subjects.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1488,"genre":"painting","materials":"Tempera on wood, 76 x 50 cm","museum_name":"Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid","name":"Portrait of Giovanna Tornabuoni","start_year":1488,"type":"portrait","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/g/ghirland/domenico/7panel/07tornab.jpg"},{"artworkid":413,"author":"TEMPEL, Abraham van den","description":"\r\nJacquemijna Le Pla (1647-1696) was the wife Justus Ghys (1638-1680), a Leiden merchant and distant cousin of van den Tempel.

They come from an Altarpiece of the Virgin (St Vaast Altarpiece) painted for the abbot between 1433 and 1435. Two of them, the Visitation and the Adoration of the Magi, are in the State Collections in Berlin; the third, the Nativity, is in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, and the fourth, the Presentation in the Temple, is in the Petit Palais museum, in Paris.\r\nOne of these four panels, The Visitation is reminiscent in its composition of paintings by Rogier Van der Weyden on the same theme. But the three others are closer - strikingly close to the art of Robert Campin, especially the Nativity which should be compared with Campin's Nativity in Dijon. The two compositions are essentially analogous: the Virgin kneels before the Infant who is lying on the ground, while Joseph holds up a lighted candle. They also share the small group of angels and the scene of the two midwives taken from an apocryphal Gospel, which Daret treats as a separate episode. Daret is less inventive than Campin, and his ambition seems limited to creating a simple tranquil atmosphere. The clothes worn by the midwives are less exotic, and the angels are holding a single phylactery. Above all, Daret's Nativity has been substantially simplified: it has fewer characters, and materials and textures are rendered with less attention than in Campin's. One has only to look at the ageing skeleton of the stable to measure the distance that separates the two artists. Certain elements have also been modified, so that, for instance, the ass and the ox in Daret's picture face towards the scene of the Birth, rather than turning their backs on it.\r\nThe other three panels show that Daret was a talented painter of the human figure and a sensitive landscape artist.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1435,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on wood, 57,5 x 52 cm","museum_name":"Muse du Petit Palais, Paris","name":"Altarpiece of the Virgin","start_year":1433,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/d/daret/stvaast4.jpg"},{"artworkid":425,"author":"SAGOT, mile","description":"\r\nThe Merveille (the marvelous) was built between 1210 and 1228 on Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy.

The cult of St Maurice, most widespread in the late Middle Ages, was first associated with the royal house of Burgundy and thereafter with Saxon and Ottonian kings. One of the main centres for the veneration of St Maurice was the eastern German city of Halle. From 1484 to 1503, during the rule of Archbishop Ernst of Wettin, the Moritzburg, the seat of the ruler, was built in Halle. Albrecht, Archbishop of Magdeburg, made the Moritzburg his main residence. He was a great patron of art, and from 1520 to 1525 he commissioned sixteen altarpieces from Lucas Cranach and his workshop; these exist today only in a fragmentary state.\r\nThis panel was probably part of a multipanel altarpiece which in closed state could comprise four very narrow panels with two each for the right and left wings.

However, it is the handling of the work that makes it unique, for the loose brushwork of earlier Impressionist style paintings has been systematized into the pointillist technique used by Seurat and Signac at this time.

She became a portrait painter of genuine merit and painted many of the most important figures of Venice. As a result of her reputation she was invited to the court of Vienna and that of Madrid but she declined these attractive offers out of affection for her father. Her early death at the age of 30 was a terrible blow to him.\r\nMarietta's skills in this specific type of portraiture are recorded by Raffaello Borghini (1584) and Claudio Ridolfi (1648) who stress the close relationship between the activity as a painter and musician of the young artist. The link between music and painting seems further strengthened by the statement that Marietta painted sketches of the gentlemen and ladies of Venice, entertaining them during their sittings with music and song.\r\nOn this canvas the young woman is shown in three-quarter figure, in a white dress in thick pleated fabric, where the colour and lines merge with those of the music sheet she holds in one hand, while the other brushes against the keys of a harpsichord. The depiction of the music in the foreground is extraordinarily accurate and possibly shows the part sung by the young woman, i.e. page 24, with the notes and text of the Cantus of the madrigal by Philippe Verdelot Madonna per voi ardo in the Primo Libro dei Madrigali, printed in Venice in 1533.  The sidelong glance and slightly turned body seem to indicate that the portrait was painted in front of a mirror and that it is indeed a self-portrait, as generally thought.\r\nMarietta does not appear to have received commissions for major religious paintings, and, like other women artists in this period, she worked primarily as a portrait painter.

The elevation in the central nave, with vast empty wall surfaces between low arcades and a high clerestory, is that of a monumental parish church.\r\nThe photo shows the nave looking east.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1485,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Basilica of Notre-Dame, Clry-Saint-Andr (Loiret)","name":"Interior view","start_year":1449,"type":"interior","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/zzzarchi/15c/2/05f_1453.jpg"},{"artworkid":483,"author":"GEERTGEN tot Sint Jans","description":"\r\nBavo is the patron saint of Gent and Lauwe, Belgium and Haarlem, the Netherlands.

His numerous older brothers were strictly only half-brothers, being the sons of Leah or of handmaidens. The events of his romantic life story have been depicted continuously in Christian art from the 6th century onwards. The medieval Church saw the episodes of his life as a prefiguration of the life of Christ, and it is to this that he owes his important place in Christian art.\r\nWhen in Egypt as a slave, Potiphar, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites and made him steward of his household (Gen. 39:7-20). Potiphar's wife 'cast her eyes over him and said, \"Come and lie with me.\"' He refused her though she continued to press him. One day when they were alone together she clutched his robes, pleading with him to make love to her. At this, Joseph fled so precipitately that he left his cloak at her hands. When Potiphar came home she avenged her humiliation by accusing Joseph of trying to violate her, using the cloak as evidence.

Francesco al Prato in Perugia. The noblewoman intended the work to commemorate her son, Grifonetto, who had been assassinated in July 1500 during the struggles between rival branches of her family to establish control over Perugia.\r\nThe altarpiece was originally composed of a large central panel showing the Deposition of Christ (now in the Borghese Gallery, Rome), a pinnacle with God the Father, Blessing between Angels (painted by a pupil, now in the National Gallery of Umbria, Perugia), and the predella. Both the main panel and the predella were carried from Perugia to Rome by Pope Paul V. They were replaced by copies in 1608.\r\nCharity, which dominates the predella from its central position, is the most complex of the three predella figures. The tondo with the personification of the virtue has clearly been influenced by Michelangelo's Pitti Madonna; on one side a putto holds a flaming torch on its shoulders, while on the other a putto tips coins out of a bowl. Hope, forming the right-hand section of the predella, has at its centre the allegorical figure. On either side are putti in confident attitudes. Faith, traditionally identified by the chalice and host, is flanked by two small angels holding plaques with the Greek inscriptions \"CPX\" and \"IHS,\" alluding to the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. \r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1507,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on wood, 16 x 44 cm","museum_name":"Pinacoteca, Vatican","name":"Theological Virtues (Faith)","start_year":1507,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/r/raphael/3umbtrip/37entom4.jpg"},{"artworkid":460,"author":"BUGLIONI, Benedetto","description":"\r\nPandolfo di Urbano Cattani, prior of the church of Sant' Andrea a Camoggiano, Barberino di Mugello, commissioned in around 1505 a  hexagonal baptismal font constructed of six white glazed reliefs illustrating episodes from the life of St John the Baptist.\r\nThe relief of the Baptism of Christ was stolen from the church at some point before the 18th century.

Rather than build a simple bell tower, Codussi opted to use the idea of a triumphal arch: this one would have a single supporting arch topped by a square panel containing a clock face and a moving dial with the signs of the zodiac. The two upper orders are smaller in size but still on square bases. The first of these contains an aedicula with the Virgin, the other the lion of St Mark with Doge Barbarigo (destroyed). The attic is crowned by a balustrade which supports two bronze Moors who ring the hours. This was the earliest, basic structure of the Torre dell'Orologio.\r\nThe tower was, however, immediately enlarged in 1499 by the addition of two side wings, giving a total of four symmetrical spans. This modification helped to accentuate the aims set for the tower in terms of perspective and stage setting; it acts as a landmark both in the Piazza itself and for the visual line leading from the Molo (pier) to the start of the Mercerie, the busiest street in Venice, giving the impression of a truly theatrical backdrop.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1499,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Piazza San Marco, Venice","name":"Torre dell'Orologio","start_year":1496,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/c/codussi/orologi1.jpg"},{"artworkid":480,"author":"MINIATURIST, French","description":"\r\nThis manuscript was illuminated by a master (Master of the Harvard Hannibal, named after a miniature in a manuscript at Harvard University) who was perhaps a pupil of the Boucicaut Master, and seems to have headed a workshop in Paris between 1415 and 1420.\r\nThe miniature on folio 227r shows the owner kneeling before the Virgin and Child.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1420,"genre":"illumination","materials":"Manuscript","museum_name":"Private collection","name":"Book of Hours","start_year":1420,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/zgothic/miniatur/1401-450/2french/16religi.jpg"},{"artworkid":484,"author":"AGOSTINO DI GIOVANNI","description":"\r\nThe monument was executed in collaboration with Agnolo di Ventura.

The painting was commissioned by Frederick the Wise, who owned relics from the massacre, and it was placed in the relic chamber of his palace church in Wittenberg. Although Dürer had never before tackled a painting with so many figures, he succeeded in integrating them into a flowing composition using vibrant colour.\r\nDürer's gruesome scene depicts scores of Christians meeting a violent death in a rocky landscape, providing a veritable compendium of tortures and killings. The oriental potentate in the blue cloak and turban who is directing the action in the lower right corner of the picture, would in Dürer's time have been perceived as a reference to the threat of Turkish invasion, because of the seizure of Constantinople in 1453. In the centre of the painting is the rather incongruous figure of the artist, holding a staff with the inscription: 'This work was done in the year 1508 by Albrecht Dürer, German.'

Instead, the fresco was to open out to the viewer as he ascended the staircase. Apollo is portrayed in the centre of the heavens, Venus and Mars rest on a cloud below him, while the zodiac appears on a band behind them with the four seasons to the left. The Horae can be recognized by their butterfly wings. The upper part of the fresco is meant to be viewed from the opposite angle and shows Mercury and, a little below him, the gods Diana, Jupiter and Saturn.\r\nThe composition of the ceiling fresco takes into account the many viewpoints available to the visitor, who changes direction several times during his climb up the stairs, and who cannot take in the whole fresco at a glance.\r\nTiepolo's achievements in composing this fresco are twofold: he takes into consideration the way in which only parts of the fresco are visible to the viewer as he climbs, and he presents independent pieces which nevertheless fuse into a harmonic whole. From the foot of the stairs the viewer first sees the continent of America, whose personification points with outstretched arm to a banner showing the mythical creature the griffin, a first allusion to the client. On entering the stairwell, a wider picture is revealed, giving a view of the dramatic cloud formations which push open the skies, and of the figure of Apollo, bathed in radiant light. Halfway up the first flight of stairs, more of the long sides of the fresco are revealed, with Africa on the right and Asia on the left. The groups of figures await the visitor almost like a court society. After this first flight, the viewer must change direction and now sees the portrayal of Europe for the first time on the short side opposite. The flourishing arts are symbolized here, partly personified by the artists involved in the construction of the Residence. Above them, the Prince-Bishop's portrait medallion is borne aloft through the heavens by geni and allegorical figures. Like Apollo, who cannot be seen from here, it too lets its light shine forth over the world.\r\nIn comparison to the other Continents, the Europa fresco is statically conceived. This, and the sometimes frontal arrangement of its figures, causes the viewer to pause and so constitutes a first high point on the way to the Imperial Hall. The fresco was, therefore, never laid out with an overall view in mind, and the criticisms of the largely empty areas of sky at its centre which were later to be frequently voiced, are thus unfounded. Instead we are captivated by the harmonic perfection through which both architecture and painted decoration serve the same purpose: the magnificent staging of the ceremonial path through the Residence.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1753,"genre":"painting","materials":"Fresco, 1900 x 3050 cm","museum_name":"Stairwell of the Residenz, Wrzburg","name":"Apollo and the Continents","start_year":1752,"type":"mythological","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/5wurzbur/3ceilin.jpg"},{"artworkid":510,"author":"DELAFOSSE, Jean-Charles","description":"\r\nJean-Charles Delafosse was an architect and a remarkable draftsman, who in 1786 published a significant book on what he called the new historical iconography.

This major commission took the form of a large diptych that was first mentioned in the city archives as a Last Judgment, but which in fact depicts The Judgment of Cambyses.

The landscape to the left belongs to Jan Wynants, or his immediate entourage.\r\n\"Amor docet musicam\" - love teaches one to play music. In all probability the artist is making reference to this aphorism known from the literature of symbols. Above the head of the young woman who is preparing to play the already opened virginal, we see prominently displayed the picture of a curly blond Amor with a bow in his right hand and a love-letter held high in his left. This picture within a picture gives a didactic content to this still-life. Such purposefulness explains the somewhat unnatural attitude of the girl. She looks at the viewer before she begins to play: this is not a pose, however, but an invitation to the viewer to look for the hidden meaning. It is one of the traits of still-life paintings with a moral lesson that one of the figures glances out of the picture, sometimes even making a gesture to indicate that the others are conveying an intellectual or moral point.\r\nThe companion painting to this brilliantly lit and coloured Vermeer creation also expresses the connection between music and love. In that picture the girl is sitting at the virginal, and on the wall behind her the viewer sees a typical Utrecht bordello scene, with a woman playing the lute and being embraced by a man wearing a hat with a feather, while the procuress looks on.\r\nYoung Amor appears in the background of other Vermeer paintings as well and the image of a musical group is also used, in every case with erotic connotations (The Music Lesson, New York, Frick Collection; The Concert, Boston Museum).\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1670,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas","museum_name":"National Gallery, London","name":"Lady Standing at a Virginal (detail)","start_year":1670,"type":"genre","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/v/vermeer/04/36stand1.jpg"},{"artworkid":565,"author":"DELAROCHE, Paul","description":"\r\nThis portrait shows the artist's son at the age of fifteen, half length with a pile of books, having recently recovered from a severe illness.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1851,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 63 x 41 cm","museum_name":"Private collection","name":"Portrait of Joseph-Carle-Paul-Horace Delaroche","start_year":1851,"type":"portrait","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/d/delaroch/8delarod.jpg"},{"artworkid":569,"author":"PALLADIO, Andrea","description":"\r\nIn 1548 Palladio received his first public commission from the town of Vicenza. The reconstruction of the original loggia surrounding the medieval town hall had collapsed in 1496, and after gathering proposals for its replacement from many of the well-known architects of the time, including Jacopo Sansovino, Sebastiano Serlio, Michele Sanmicheli and Giulio Romano, the town council decided in favour of the design by the local architect Palladio, thus firmly establishing his reputation.\r\nPalladio's solution for the loggia of the Palazzo della Ragione (also known as the Basilica) is brilliantly convincing, not least because of the use of the Serlian motif with which he concealed the irregularities of the inner structure, particularly the different widths of the bays, by varying the side openings while giving the building a harmonious general appearance. The idea of a double skin for the building derives from the structure of ancient Roman theatre walls, the vertical axes of which are articulated by equal-sized openings on the different floors and by engaged columns set in front of the walls. In addition, Palladio projected the Serliana - subsequently also called the Palladian motif - in the third dimension, since its columns are duplicated towards the interior of the loggia. The boundary between the building and the piazza was thus made permeable, as befitted the building's function as the seat of the town council.\r\nPalladio's design combines various elements derived from the same historical source, but without producing a sense of monotony. The model for the two-storey casing was the Palazzo della Ragione, Padua, which was surrounded by two-storey arcades in the first half of the 15th century. There, however, each arch on the ground floor is matched by two openings with slender marble columns on the upper floor. In the Basilica, instead of differentiating between the two levels, Palladio offered a uniform structure, albeit one that gives a general impression of variety despite its rigorous discipline. This effect results not least from the masons' virtuoso handling of the many details of the building, which was not completed until 1617.\r\nView the first floor plan of the Basilica, Vicenza.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1549,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Basilica, Vicenza","name":"Exterior view","start_year":1549,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/p/palladio/2/basilicb.jpg"},{"artworkid":573,"author":"BRONZINO, Agnolo","description":"\r\nThe young Ludovico Capponi (1534-1614) is depicted at the age of seventeen.

After the end of the Napoleonic wars, there was a great desire, as in other countries, to come up with a distinct national style. The culmination of these endeavours was the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament in London, after the devastating fire in 1834. For the first time with such a major commission, the Gothic Revival was considered appropriate for a building of such national significance. The competition in 1835 was won by Sir Charles Barry, and his design realized in the Perpendicular style has become a national symbol.\r\nSir Charles Barry, assisted by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-1852), designed the present buildings in the Gothic Revival style. Construction was begun in 1837, the cornerstone was laid in 1840, and work was finished in 1860. The Commons Chamber was burned out in one of the numerous air raids that targeted London during World War II, but it was restored and reopened in 1950.\r\nExternally, apart from the Gothic detail, it conforms to the requirements of both Classical and Picturesque architectural doctrines.

In a frame of a standing oblong shape, which gives a three-dimensional effect, the crucified Christ is represented between the figures of the Virgin and of St John the Evangelist. The marginal decoration of scrolls of acanthus leaves springs from the corners of the frame, and encircles a small, round field at the bottom, where the Vir Dolorum is depicted.\r\nThe acanthus decoration which had been made some 10-20 years earlier in the workshop which executed commissions for the Emperor Wenceslas, is here arranged in a more regular and decorative manner, the scrolls and leaves being even more stylized. They have virtually assumed a metallic hardness. In the picture itself the features which formerly characterized the International Gothic style have been further modified to the point of being exaggerated. All elements in the picture have been made secondary to a desire for decorativeness: Christ's ribs form a regular pattern of parallel lines, as do the veins of the wood of the cross. The crown of thorns looks like an ornamental head-dress rather than an instrument of torture; and the drops of blood falling from the wound of Christ on the kerchief of the Virgin harmonize beautifully with her cherry-red lips. Though the figures beside the cross are slender, in accordance with the taste of the period, they are wrapped in enormously ample draperies. But to show the Virgin so full of joie de vivre that she almost seems to be dancing does not suit the mood of this picture. Furthermore, St John is so enveloped in a mass of draperies disproportionate to his small head that he appears to be hiding someone under his garments. His right arm extended to touch the cross looks rather distorted; it is too long and is twisted at the wrist in a strange, unnatural manner. These extremely stylized idioms of form fit the abstract and symbolic figure of the Vir Dolorum better; even so, the way that the end of His loincloth is placed in front of the sarcophagus and arranged in a decorative manner, seems to indicate certain playfulness whose purpose is not fully clarified.\r\nInternational Gothic art, no doubt, had always been in danger of becoming exaggeratedly stylized, and by the time the style was coming to an end this contrived and purposeless formalism had begun to dominate it, particularly in the work of minor artists.\r\nIn the miniature in Brno a feature appears which is in sharp contrast to the accepted qualities of the International Gothic style, a feature which is more characteristic of the art of subsequent decades: instead of soft, wavy lines the folds show harder lines and sharper angles (particularly in the mantle of St John.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1413,"genre":"illumination","materials":"Manuscript, 415 x 295 mm","museum_name":"Town Archive, Brno","name":"Olomouc Missal","start_year":1413,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/zgothic/miniatur/1401-450/7other/13_1401.jpg"},{"artworkid":582,"author":"MINIATURIST, Flemish","description":"\r\nThe main illumination of the page (folio 48v) depicts the Crucifixion.

In 1549 he collaborated with Jean Cousin the Elder in organizing the ceremonial entry of Henry II into Paris, an event that allowed the new generation of classicizing artists to display their skills. Goujon's most famous work, the Fountain of the Innocents, the architecture of which was probably by Lescot, was originally built as a monument for this occasion. It was, until 1787, a rectangular structure on a corner, presenting two arched bays to the Rue aux Fers and one to the Rue Saint-Denis. The bays were articulated by fluted composite pilasters, between which were narrow vertical relief panels of nymphs holding urns. Horizontal relief panels of tritons and nymphs were placed above and below each bay, and the spandrels of the arches were filled by winged personifications of Fame.\r\nThe present appearance of the monument, as a free-standing, four-sided structure, is the result of a late 18th-century rebuilding for which Augustin Pajou provided extra sculpture in an able pastiche of Goujon's style. The vertical relief panels remain in situ, but the horizontal ones were removed around 1810 (now Musée du Louvre, Paris). All these reliefs, with their undulating contours, light, transparent draperies and finesse of execution, exude a pagan gaiety. Goujon transformed his sources in engravings after Rosso and antique sculpture to create a masterpiece of grace and harmony in which an echo of Hellenistic art can be caught.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1549,"genre":"sculpture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Place Joachim du Bellay, Paris","name":"Fontaine des Innocents","start_year":1549,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/g/goujon/innocen4.jpg"},{"artworkid":606,"author":"GAUGUIN, Paul","description":"\r\nThe technique of this painting is related to Seurat's pointillism.

Indeed Christus's delicately wrought and brilliantly coloured works served to popularise the technique and manner of Van Eyck.\r\nSome fifteen to twenty works by Christus are known, one of which is The Virgin and Child, probably the surviving part of a triptych for home devotion. Framed by a semi-circular arch resting on slender columns and with a pleasant landscape in the background, the Virgin looks tenderly down at the naked Infant supported on her arm. Every detail has been painted with meticulous care - the minute wrinkles on the Infant's face, the foliage of the trees in the distance and the statuette of Adam and Eve on the columns at the sides, which, in alluding to the Fall, emphasize the coming Redemption through Christ.

However, it is debated by others. The pose of the recently married couple, leaning against the trunk of a tree, emphasizes the casual air of the portrait. The ivy twining itself around the tree and curling round at the woman's feet, who, in turn, has her hand negligently resting on the man's shoulder, symbolizes the permanence of the marriage. The thistle growing next to the man in the bare patch of ground at the bottom left of the picture may be an allusion to God's word to Adam after the Fall: \"Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee.\" (Genesis 3, 17f.) Thus, the thistle may symbolize labour, itself a consequence of the Fall. In puritanical Calvinist ethics, which had already gained considerable currency in the Netherlands, work was considered a cardinal virtue, and achievement a central aspect of personal conduct.\r\nFrans Hals's work for this bourgeois couple included an Italian landscape background on the right - a sunlit villa, marble statue and spring - whose purpose was to create the impression of elevated rank and dignified elegance. However, the background features are fanciful, bearing no relation whatsoever to the real world of the couple. Rather than the couple's country residence, scrutiny of iconographical details shows the villa to be the temple of Juno, the goddess of marriage, whose attribute was the peacock.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1622,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 140 x 166,5 cm","museum_name":"Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam","name":"Married Couple in a Garden","start_year":1622,"type":"portrait","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/h/hals/frans/01-1623/12coupl.jpg"},{"artworkid":611,"author":"GHIRLANDAIO, Davide","description":"\r\nFormerly the painting was attributed to Domenico Ghirlandaio, the brother of the artist.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1480,"genre":"painting","materials":"Tempera on panel, 65 x 42 cm","museum_name":"Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge","name":"Virgin and Child Enthroned between St Ursula and St Catherine","start_year":1480,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/g/ghirland/davide/virgin_e.jpg"},{"artworkid":615,"author":"ARCHITECT, French","description":"\r\nFirst built as a fortress in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade; begun in 1287 and under construction for 200 years, Albi Cathedral is claimed to be the largest brick building in the world.\r\nThe Gothic cathedral was constructed in brick between 1287 to 1480 in the wake of the Cathar Church, a Christian non-trinitarian dualist movement with an episcopal see at Albi.

While Martin is praying he is approached by a woman holding her dead child in her arms; she begs him to do something and the Saint kneels in prayer. Amidst the astonishment of those present the child is resurrected.\r\nIt was pointed out that Simone does not follow the official biographies (which all report the incident as having taken place in the countryside around Chartres), but blends this event with a legend that was popular in Siena at the time. This legend was a longstanding oral tradition, which we know of from a 1657 source; it tells the story of Martin stopping in Siena while on his way to Rome on a pilgrimage. In Siena he performed a miracle so great that a church consecrated to him was built in the city. The miracle was a resurrection and this is the connection that justifies Simone's blending of the two episodes and changing the setting to Siena. The city centre is symbolized by the building to the right: the square-topped battlements, the three-light mullioned windows on the piano nobile and the Sienese arch above the entrance door help us identify it as the Palazzo Pubblico. This is how the town hall appeared before 1325 when the bell tower, the Torre del Mangia, was added to the left.\r\nThe need to make the event recounted more immediate, to modernize an episode that had occurred almost a thousand years before, made Simone go even further. The crowd does not consist only of pagans, as the written accounts of the event described it; Simone portrays a most varied group of onlookers. A plump friar is shown looking up at a tree above the scene: he looks very much like Gentile da Montefiore.

It was commissioned by Swiss-born Maximilian Neuscheller (1860-1919), a wealthy, cosmopolitan businessman based in St. Petersburg who travelled widely and was a knowledgeable patron of the arts.\r\nIn 1900 Neuscheller purchased the Suur-Merijoki estate on the Karelia Isthmus, a popular vacationing spot among the St. Petersburg elite. Two years later, he enlisted the services of the promising Finnish architect trio to design a summer villa for himself and his family.\r\nThe young architects Herman Gesellius (1874-1916), Armas Lindgren (1874-1929) and Eliel Saarinen (1873-1950) founded a three-man architectural practice in 1896, while all three were still undergraduates. They made their first breakthrough as designers of the Finnish pavilion at the Paris World's Fair. Wealthy Neuscheller offered the young architects a unique opportunity by giving them the chance to design a 'total work of art' in the Art Nouveau style, sparing no expense, complete with furniture and textiles. The architects were assisted by a large team of artisans, painters and sculptors. The manor was built in 1902-03.\r\nSuur-Merijoki Major was situated in an unusual location atop a small hill in the middle of a spruce forest. The main villa had the look of a Gothic castle with medieval touches such as turrets, nature granite boulders in the plinths and elevations, and tapering windows.\r\nNeuscheller died in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution in 1919, after which his family sold the estate to the Finnish government in 1927. The manor was badly damaged during the Winter War, but some of its furnishings were salvaged and evacuated to Finland. The estate was relinquished to the Soviet Union in 1944. Today there is nothing left of the once-splendid manor but rubble and ruin.\r\nEliel Saarinen's watercolour of 1902 shows the exterior of the manor.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1902,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Watercolour","museum_name":"Museum of Finnish Architecture, Helsinki","name":"Suur-Merijoki Manor: exterior","start_year":1902,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/s/saarinen/1manor1.jpg"},{"artworkid":677,"author":"RUBENS, Peter Paul","description":"\r\nThis is one of Rubens' rare night scenes.

The Venus and Adonis became the prototype for a whole series of replicas of this subject.\r\nVenus, the goddess of love, falls in love with Adonis, a beautiful youth. Her love is not, however, enough to stop him pursuing his favourite pastime, hunting, which will lead to his undoing, for he is gored to death by a boar. There is an interesting letter from Titian to Philip II which deals with this painting. The artist makes a special point of mentioning that he was particularly interested in depicting the body from both sides.\r\nIn both paintings the scene of the union of the lovers is bathed in the warm light of sunset, where the diffuse softness of the colours holds sway. The female nudes reveal the continuing inspiration of Michelangelo's sculpture, such as the Dawn and Night from the Medici tombs in Florence. But what is entirely personal to Titian is the quality of the colour, which fragments into patches of dazzling luminosity - a perfect complement to the ecstatic sensuous abandon of the figures.\r\nIn its own day Venus and Adonis was considered one of Titian's most erotic works, especially in the compression of Venus' buttocks in her seated pose, but it also suggests the indulgent condescension of a younger man towards the frantic and overprotective reaction of an older woman.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1554,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 180 x 207 cm","museum_name":"Museo del Prado, Madrid","name":"Venus and Adonis","start_year":1554,"type":"mythological","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/t/tiziano/08b/2venus_a.jpg"},{"artworkid":660,"author":"GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico","description":"\r\nThis painting is probably the earliest panel painting by Ghirlandaio.

Bassano's workshop painted innumerable replicas of these compositions, which came to be known even beyond the Alps through prints, in particular those made by the members of the Sadeler family.\r\nIn this painting the theme of summer is introduced by a scene of sheep-shearing and a woman pausing for repose with three children.

A document of 2nd July 1577 referring to this painting is the earliest record of El Greco in Spain. El Greco has produced one of the most dignified and moving portrayals of Christ in art. The powerful effect of the painting especially depends upon his original and forceful use of colour. Something of the effect of the grand images of the Saviour in Byzantine art is recalled. The motif of the crowding round Christ suggests an acquaintance with the works of the Northern artist, Bosch; the figure preparing the Cross could be derived from the similar figure bending forward in Raphael's tapestry cartoon of the Miraculous Draught of Fishes. This is, however, the last time that there are any hints of specific borrowings.\r\nThe painting shows Christ clad in a bright red robe and looking up to Heaven with an expression of serenity as he is being tormented by his captors. A figure in the background bearing a red hat points at Christ accusingly, while two others argue over his garments. A man in green to Christ's left holds him firmly with a rope and is about to rip off his robe in preparation for his crucifixion. At the lower right, a man in yellow bends over the cross and drills a hole to facilitate the insertion of a nail to be driven through Christ's feet. The clouds above Christ, painted in strong diagonals, provide a 'path' of uplifting communication between Christ and God the Father. On the left side of the composition, the three Marys contemplate the event with distress. Above them a soldier wearing a suit of armour reminiscent of those fabricated in sixteenth-century Toledo stares out directly at the viewer. El Greco may have intended this figure to be a contemporary portrait.\r\nA small, signed version of the Espolio, at Upton Park, Warwickshire, the original preliminary model is probably for the large painting. Many other versions exist, but few can be by El Greco. The only occasion that he treated the subject was for the Cathedral, but the type of Christ created in the Espolio is taken up in the related subject of Christ carrying the Cross, and in other representations of Christ.\r\nThe initial reception of the painting, when seen by the artists brought to value it, was that it was beyond appraisal. After the artist's death, the first real recognition of the painting was some two centuries later when Goya painted his Taking of Christ for the same sacristy.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1579,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 285 x 173 cm","museum_name":"Sacristy of the Cathedral, Toledo","name":"The Disrobing of Christ (El Espolio)","start_year":1577,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/g/greco_el/04/0402grec.jpg"},{"artworkid":694,"author":"VELDE, Henry van de","description":"\r\nThis gracious mansion is the work of architect Octave Van Rysselberghe and designer Henry van de Velde, who designed the interior.

These panels were intended for the decoration of altars and the choice of theme was confined to the symbolic representation of figures from the New Testament. Scenes from the lives of saints were but rarely depicted. In practically every one of these panels we find centrally placed in the composition the figure of the Virgin or of Christ, surrounded by a round or oval halo. Round the central figure are narrative scenes or a hieratic arrangement of the apostles.\r\nThis panel, now in Barcelona, is a typical example of such a retable. Its painter is referred to as the Master of Seo de Urgell. There are innumerable contemporary miniatures in which the faces and the drapery of the garments have been painted in a similarly stereotyped manner. Every single figure is schematic: the apostles stand stiffly upright, each one holding some object by which he can be identified - and yet the artist has breathed life into these figures. Christ, judging the world, places his hand on a book with the very gesture that might be used by a student of the law as he closes the codex in which he has sought guidance in reaching a fair jjudgment. At the same time there is in the iconography all the naivete of folk-art: the detail and ornamental elements convey the painter's delight in unrestricted decoration.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1100,"genre":"painting","materials":"Tempera on wood, 130 x 150 cm","museum_name":"Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona","name":"Christ and the Twelve Apostles","start_year":1100,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/m/master/zunk_sp/zunk_cat/001chris.jpg"},{"artworkid":728,"author":"BELLINI, Giovanni","description":"\r\nThe detail shows the landscape at the right side of the painting.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1488,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas","museum_name":"San Pietro Martire, Murano","name":"Barbarigo Altarpiece (detail)","start_year":1488,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/b/bellini/giovanni/1480-89/3barbari/135barb3.jpg"},{"artworkid":732,"author":"MANTEGNA, Andrea","description":"\r\nThis photograph was taken before the chapel was destroyed on 11 March 1944.

Maria del Popolo which he could have seen when he made his second visit to Rome. However, the differences which exist between the two statues are significant. Bernini's Daniel is more plastic in its conception than Puget's Sebastian. Daniel surges forward in the movement of prayer, right out of the niche; St Sebastian falls in a pose contained by the plane closing the front of the niche.

When he was a boy of thirteen his parents settled in Amsterdam; apart from trips to the Rhineland, the northern, and the southern Netherlands he spent his life there. He painted some imaginary cityscapes based on studies done in Germany, which at first blush appear to be true-to-life views, and lovely capriccios which show expert knowledge of the principles of classical architecture. His oeuvre also includes about forty landscapes that reveal a debt to Adriaen van de Velde, who is credited with painting figures in some of his pictures, and a few intriguing still-lifes that can be justifiably categorized as interiors. Van der Heyden is best known for his views of Amsterdam.\r\nMost of van der Heyden's paintings were done in the sixties and seventies - his work as inventor, entrepreneur, and city official probably slacked his pace. But he continued to paint until the very end. His latest firmly datable picture, Still-life with Rarities, now in Budapest, shows the corner of a 'Kunstkamer' in strong even light with meticulous depictions of rarities from the natural and man-made world, but not the collector who assembled them. It is proudly inscribed with his monogram and states he painted it when he was seventy-five years old; he attained that age in 1712, the year he died.\r\nAmong the objects displayed in the Kunstkamer, which is most probably a fictive one, are a hanging armour of an armadillo, a copy after an etching of Pietro Testa's Suicide of Dido above the marble mantle, an inlaid cabinet used for housing treasured coins and natural specimens, oriental weapons, and on the bright red Chinese embroidered cloth that covers the table globes, one terrestrial and the other celestial, and an open Blaeu atlas. Next to the table there is a red damask covered chair that supports a folio Bible open at the favourite passage of Dutch moralists: Ecclesiastes, Chapter I, which begins with 'The words of the Preacher . . . vanity of vanities; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?' The biblical reference to transience is reinforced by Testa's Suicide of Dido, a subject taken from Virgil's Aeneid which can be read as an exemplum of love's ephemeral nature.\r\nVan der Heyden's message is obvious and familiar. It is one we have heard from other still-life specialists: preparation for salvation is of greater importance than all the treasures, pleasures, and knowledge that can be derived from this world.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1712,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 74 x 64 cm","museum_name":"Szpmvszeti Mzeum, Budapest","name":"Still-Life with Rarities","start_year":1712,"type":"still-life","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/h/heyden/rarities.jpg"},{"artworkid":734,"author":"RENOIR, Pierre-Auguste","description":"\r\nThis painting is a study of a nude for which the model was Lise Tréhot, the artist's mistress.

The Massacre of the Innocents was one of the most celebrated and widely reproduced engravings of the sixteenth century, which established the decade long, fruitful collaboration of Raphael and the Bolognese engraver Marcantonio Raimondi.\r\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century there was no significant printmaking activity in Rome thus it was an ideal place for Raphael to launch a printmaking and publishing enterprise. Beyond the immediate profit to be gained from selling prints, the painter must also have been motivated by the advantages lying in the reproduction and distribution of his own compositions. Since Raphael was inexperienced in both printmaking and publishing, he was in need of suitable partners. He appointed one of his apprentices, Baviero de' Carocci (active c. 1515-1527) to supervise the printing and sale of prints after his designs.\r\nMarcantonio Raimondi made six engravings for Raphael. These were the products of an operation for which Raphael provided the designs, Raimodi the engraving skills, and Baviera the organization of the printing and sale.

This conferred on women of high rank the privilege of granting to persecuted people who called upon their aid the so-called \"protection of the mantle\" - safe refuge and freedom from persecution. This motif is found in theological literature from the early 13th century onward, and it soon appeared in the plastic arts, emerging as a devotional image in the late 13th century and becoming widespread during the two following centuries. The religious aspect of this legally based symbol was applied not to the Virgin alone, as the most powerful of the intercessors before God's throne, but also to other female saints such as St Ursula or St Odilia. The Cistercians and Dominicans in particular contributed, notably by accounts of visions, to the wide distribution of this image.\r\nThe famous Madonna of Mercy in the Berlin sculpture collection, originally attributed by art historians to the Ravensburg sculptor Friedrich Schramm, is now unanimously considered to be the work of Michel Erhart of Ulm. The Virgin stands, tall and slender, on a grassy plinth. Showing movement only to the extent of a slight curving of the body, she protectively holds up her garment in the gesture of the \"protection of the mantle\". Beneath it a large number of the faithful find refuge. Her elegant reserve and the nobility of her posture match the refined facial expression, emphasized by her strikingly slender throat. These features, together with the artistic framing of her face by the wavy hair falling to her shoulders and the shawl covering her hair, reflect Erhart's endeavour to achieve in sculpture an idealized image of beauty, an effect further enhanced by the largely original polychrome colouring.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1480,"genre":"sculpture","materials":"Painted limewood, height 135 cm","museum_name":"Staatliche Museen, Berlin","name":"Ravensburg Madonna of Mercy","start_year":1480,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/e/erhart/michael/ravensbu.jpg"},{"artworkid":765,"author":"GALLI, Agostino","description":"\r\nOne of the most beautiful and well preserved Renaissance palaces in Prague is situated near Prague Castle on the Hradcanske square.

The ruins were bought by Jan Popel Lobkowicz, one of the richest noblemen in Bohemia and later on Prague's highest burgrave.

The walls of the palace enclose a square courtyard divided from the Hradcanske square by a wall and a grille gate. \r\nThe palace was built by the Italian Agostino Galli, who originally designed a typical Italian palazzo with wings around a square courtyard.

The composition is derived in its essentials from the altarpiece painted by Veronese in 1573 for the church of San Silvestro, Venice (now in the National Gallery, London) and anticipates the altarpiece painted by Tiepolo in 1753 for the monastery of Schwarzach in Franconia (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich). All three works are large, but the composition by Tiepolo differs from the others, which are almost square in format, by being compressed into a vertical.\r\nThe Adoration of the Magi was acquired by George III in 1762 from Consul Joseph Smith and formed part of a series of seven pictures of New Testament subjects. The related paintings are Christ and the Woman who Believed, Christ and the Woman of Samaria, The Magdalen anointing Christ's Feet (all still in the Royal Collection), The Pool of Bethesda and The Woman taken in Adultery (Ministry of Works, presently at Osterley House) and The Sermon on the Mount, which is lost. All these paintings, with the exception of the present work, illustrate scenes from Christ's ministry.\r\nThe origin of the commission for this series of paintings is unknown. The size of the undertaking (the dimensions in each case are extremely large and there are fundamental changes in format) has caused the series to be associated with an unrecorded commission for the Royal House of Savoy in Turin, for whom Ricci worked during the 1720s.\r\nThe painting demonstrates Sebastiano Ricc's role in the evolution of Rococo art in Venice, which reached its climax in the work of Tiepolo. The setting of The Adoration of the Magi is dramatic, the brushwork full of verve and panache and the colours bright. Several changes in the composition can be seen with the naked eye, especially in the centre. The artist travelled extensively in Italy and also worked in England from 1711/12 to 1716, returning home via France. He formed a partnership with his nephew, Marco (1676-1730), who, according to Gherardi, painted the architectural background to The Adoration of the Magi and the related pictures.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1730,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 330,2 x 289,6 cm","museum_name":"Royal Collection, Windsor","name":"The Adoration of the Magi","start_year":1726,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/r/ricci/sebastia/2/adoratio.jpg"},{"artworkid":781,"author":"PRE-ROMANESQUE SCULPTOR, German","description":"\r\nPicture stones are almost exclusively found on Gotland and show mythological scenes.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":-1,"genre":"sculpture","materials":"Limestone","museum_name":"Swedish History Museum, Stockholm","name":"Picture stone","start_year":-1,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/zearly/2/1sculptu/various/variou09.jpg"},{"artworkid":785,"author":"KEYSER, Thomas de","description":"\r\nThis painting belongs to a group of small full-length portraits in meticulously delineated interiors, executed by the Amsterdam artist Thomas de Keyser in the 1620s and 30s, which were extremely influential upon the development of Dutch portrait painting in the second quarter of the seventeenth century.

Midwestern agriculture thrived in the early 20th century, leading to a revolution in rural banking and the proliferation of small institutions sympathetic to local needs.\r\nSullivan's first commission in this field was the magnificent National Farmers' Bank (1907-08) in Owatonna, Minnesota. It was followed by the People's Savings Bank (1911), Cedar Rapids, Iowa; the Merchants' Bank (1914), Grinnell, Iowa; the Home Building Association Bank (1914), Newark, Ohio; the Purdue State Bank (1914), West Lafayette, Indiana; the People's Federal Savings and Loan Association (1917-18), Sidney, Ohio; and finally the Farmers and Merchants Union Bank (1919) in Columbus, Wisconsin.\r\nThese buildings posed no problems in the expression of structure, as they were all low, load-bearing brick constructions; they did, however, raise important questions of institutional expression. Sullivan's solution was to make them monumental, as befitted banks, but 'modern' and unrelated to historical precedent in order to communicate their transformed character. They are the final and most richly impressive demonstrations of his ornamental skill, with their rich use of polychromy in brick and terracotta. Furthermore, the design of each was sensitively adapted to its setting, usually at the end of the main street facing the town square (as at Owatonna, Grinnell, Newark, Sidney, and Columbus).\r\nCompleted in 1914, the Purdue State Bank is the smallest and least expensive of Sullivan's \"Jewel Boxes,\" a series of Midwestern banks designed in the modern style at the end of his career. Built on a tiny, trapezoidal lot between two streets, the structure is less ornamental than most of the architect's other work; it includes only a few terra cotta panels. During the 1950s, a stone portion was added to the back of the building, and the original doorway was converted into a window and then an ATM.\r\nThe photo shows the southern side and the former main entrance to the Purdue State Bank (now a Chase bank).\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1914,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"210 West State Street,West Lafayette, Indiana","name":"Purdue State Bank","start_year":1914,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/s/sullivan/85purdu1.jpg"},{"artworkid":751,"author":"TERBORCH, Gerard","description":"\r\nThe independence of the Netherlands was recognised by the Treaty of Munster which was signed between the Dutch and the Spanish in 1648.

Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).\r\nUnder the sons of Filippo II Colonna (1663-1714) more additions were made to the palace. A new wing was erected between 1730-33 by Nicola Michetti. Of this wing only the corner pavilion has survived unchanged, and in it is one of the loveliest interiors from the Roman Rococo, the Coffeehouse. The most important eighteenth-century additions were completed under Cardinal Girolamo II Colonna (1708-1763). He commissioned Paolo Posi to build a gallery in the highly theatrical style of the eighteenth century. The cardinal's favourite painter was Stefano Pozzi who, together with his brother Giuseppe (1723-1765) and the landscape painter Giovanni Angeloni (1740-1788), painted the doors, mirrors, and wall panels of Girolamo's apartment, the so-called Salone Turco, with cheerful and decorative arabesques and small-format scenes.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1758,"genre":"painting","materials":"Fresco","museum_name":"Palazzo Colonna, Rome","name":"Wall decoration","start_year":1758,"type":"mythological","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/p/pozzi/turco1.jpg"},{"artworkid":763,"author":"REMBRANDT Harmenszoon van Rijn","description":"\nCatalogue number: Benesch 257.\r\nThis drawing is in the friendship album of Burchard Grossmann.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1634,"genre":"graphics","materials":"Ink and wash, 89 x 71 mm","museum_name":"Koninklijke Bibliotheek, The Hague","name":"Bearded old man","start_year":1634,"type":"portrait","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/r/rembrand/53drawin/3/64portr.jpg"},{"artworkid":767,"author":"BELLUCCI, Antonio","description":"\r\nThe style of this painting reflects Bellucci's formative period in Venice from the late 1670s onwards, and in particular the influence of painters such as Antonio Zanchi.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1693,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 109 x 135 cm","museum_name":"Private collection","name":"Rebecca at the Well","start_year":1691,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/b/bellucci/rebecca.jpg"},{"artworkid":771,"author":"ZANCHI, Antonio","description":"\r\nJosiah was the King of Judah who was killed in the battle at Megiddo in 609 BC.

What started as a small religious community became the core of a monastic city, with much commercial activity and hundreds of lay inhabitants.\r\nThe range and quality of stone carving to be found at Clonmacnois are unparalleled in Ireland. The sculpture falls into a number of categories. Over 400 incised grave slabs survive from the early monastic period (7th–12th century), decorated with various forms of cross. Many are inscribed with personal names. Standard designs using knotwork, spirals, and frets in a restrained manner were used over a long period. One of the most attractive is a Latin cross with expanded semicircular terminals.\r\nThe 'Cross of the Scriptures', with its well-modelled, rounded figure sculpture, is a product of the Durrow–Monasterboice workshop. A worn inscription on the east side mentions the names of Abbot Colman (d 926) and King Flann (d 916) and has been the subject of much debate. The cross (h. 3.38 m) is made of two pieces of stone, with shaft, ring and cap all cut from a monolith. In contrast to other Irish crosses, the ring projects in front of the cross arms, which are tilted upwards.

The fresco cycles in these two rooms constitute the first private fresco commission given to Pellegrini after his return to Venice from Rome. His stay in Rome had been beneficial to his development, enabling him to incorporate into his own visual repertory the language of Luca Giordano and Baciccio.\r\nIn the central hall, within faux-stucco frames, are depictions of mythological scenes inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses. The frescoes are located within vertical compartments of various sizes on the walls of the hall, which, because of its elongated shape, seems almost like a gallery. The light is diffused through three large, arched windows. The windowed wall contains the paintings Apollo and Daphne, Sleeping Endymion, Salmacis and the Hermaphrodite, and Cadmus Sowing the Dragons Teeth. The two short walls have the Rape of Deianira and Narcissus at the Spring on one side, and the Rape of Europa and on the other. Mercury and Argus. The entrance wall has the representations Danaë and the Shower of Gold, Venus Weeping over the Death of Adonis, and Pan and Syrinx.\r\nAbove, a painted frieze of interwoven laurel leaves circle the perimeter of the room. Perched atop the frieze, are child musicians, parrots, squirrels, and little monkeys. The decorative program is completed on the curvature of the ceiling, where eight inserts depict putti and little satyrs at play.

David's painting of Marat represents the peak of his involvement in the Revolution where invention, style, fervent belief and devotion combine to produce one of the most perfect examples of political painting. David presented the painting to the Convention on 14 November 1793.\r\nJean-Paul Marat saw himself as a friend of the people, he was a doctor of medicine and a physicist, and above all he was editor of the news-sheet Ami du peuple. He suffered from a skin disease and had to perform his business for the revolution in a soothing bath. This is where David shows him, in the moment after the pernicious murder by Charlotte Corday, a supporter of the aristocracy. David had seen his fellow party member and friend the day before. Under the impact of their personal friendship David created his painting \"as if in a trance,\" as one of his pupils later reported.\r\nDavid takes the viewer into Marat's private room, making him the witness of the moments immediately after the murder. Marat's head and arm have sunk down, but the dead hand still holds pen and paper. This snapshot of exactly the minute between the last breath and death in the bathroom had an immense impact at the time, and it still has the same effect today.\r\nDavid has used a dark, immeasurable background to intensify the significance. The boldness of the high half of the room above the figure concentrates attention on the lowered head, and makes us all the more aware of the vacuum that has been created. The distribution of light here has been reversed from the usual practice, with dark above light. This is not only one of the most moving paintings of the time, but David has also created a secularised image of martyrdom. The painting has often, and rightly, been compared with Michelangelo's Pietà in Rome; in both the most striking element is the arm hanging down lifeless. Thus David has unobtrusively taken over the central image of martyrdom in Christianity to his image of Marat. Revolutionary and anti-religious as the painting of this period claimed to be, it is evident here that it very often had recourse to the iconography and pictorial vocabulary of the religious art of the past.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1793,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 162 x 128 cm","museum_name":"Muses Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels","name":"The Death of Marat","start_year":1793,"type":"historical","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/d/david_j/3/301david.jpg"},{"artworkid":791,"author":"VOUET, Simon","description":"\r\nThis early self-portrait shows Vouet's intuitive talent for capturing transitory effects.

The Apollo and the Muses on Mount Helion (Parnassus) of 1680 in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is a good example of his use of idyllic mythology during his last years. His technique remained as refined as in his earlier years, but his compositions often lost the earlier sense of perfect balance in the trees of different sizes and densities on each side of the picture. Sometimes, as in the Boston picture, the whole appears rather awkward, especially in reproductions which tend to emphasize the patterns made by the landscape against the sky. In front of the original, however, these awkwardnesses disappear because one becomes aware that the artist is concentrating entirely on atmosphere, to the exclusion of everything else.\r\nThe mythological story depicted on the picture is the following.\r\nApollo, as the God of Poetry and Music (in this role named Apollo Musagetes), dwells on Mount Parnassus, accompanied by the muses, the goddesses of poetic inspiration and the creative arts in general. The running brook is the Castilian spring, which, like another, the Pierian, was a source of inspiration and learning where we are advised to drink deep.\r\nThe painting was executed for the Principe Colonna, and was in the family collection until at least 1783.

The leading exponents of this period were van Dyck and Lely. This portrait of Henrietta Maria, Queen of England is an idealized portrait.\r\nHenrietta Maria of France (1609-1669), the daughter of King Henry IV of France and Marie de Médici, was the Queen consort of England, Scotland and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I. She was mother of two kings, Charles II and James II and grandmother of two queens and one king, Mary II, William III and Anne of Great Britain as well as paternal aunt of Louis XIV of France. She had married Charles I in 1625, but soon fell out of favour with Parliament and the people because of her support for English Catholics. Later, she tried in vain and with great personal commitment, to help her husband. After the execution of Charles I in 1649, she settled in Paris. In 1660, when her oldest son succeeded to the throne as Charles II of Great Britain and Ireland, Henrietta Maria returned to England where she lived as Dowager Queen and Queen Mother until 1665 when she returned permanently to France. She died at the age of 59 at the château de Colombes, near Paris, marking the end of a turbulent life. She was buried in the French royal necropolis at the Basilica of St Denis.\r\nLely portrays her here as a beautiful and dignified woman in royal dress with an expression of suffering on her lips and a look of aloof mourning in her eyes. This is no longer a Baroque representative portrait, but tends far more in the direction of an individual interpretative portrayal. The nature of her life's journey is hidden by her reserved facial expression.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1660,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas, 49 x 39 cm","museum_name":"Muse Cond, Chantilly","name":"Henrietta Maria of France, Queen of England","start_year":1660,"type":"portrait","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/l/lely/henriett.jpg"},{"artworkid":810,"author":"ARCHITECT, French","description":"\r\nThe ground was laid for classicism during the regime of Henry IV (reg 1589-1610). The buildings for which Henry IV was directly responsible must be considered in two groups: the additions to the royal palaces, and the improvements to the city of Paris. Of the former the finest example is the stable courtyard portal built by Rémy Collin in a square court (Cour des Offices) open on one side towards the Cour de l'Ovale.\r\nFar more revolutionary are Henry IV's improvements to the city of Paris. It was in accordance with his general policy that he should want to embellish his capital, and in keeping with his character that his improvements should be of a very practical kind. In twelve years he completed the Pont Neuf, built the Place Royale and the Place Dauphine and began the Place de France, created the Hôpital Saint-Louis and laid the foundations of the Collège Royal. In these works Henry IV brought town-planning to a new stage and established certain principles which were to influence the development of Paris for several centuries.\r\nBy the beginning of the 17th century the tide of ornament had became typical for architects to rely simply on the contrast between rusticated quoins at the salient points of their structures and rendered or unrendered brick infill. This is nowhere better illustrated than in the relatively modest houses surrounding the Place Dauphine (1607-15) and the Place Royale (from 1605; now Place des Vosges), which Henry IV laid out in Paris as the nuclei for ordered development in the city. \r\nThe Place Royale was conceived in 1604 and carried out from 1605 onwards. It was built on the site of the old royal palace of the Tournelles, which was abandoned by Catherine de' Medici after the death of Henry II in the tournament held there. The style of the houses was simple. We find on the ground floor an arcaded cloister. The elevation in the upper storeys has stucco 'chaines' against the brick, and there are very simple dormers.\r\nView the site plan of Place des Vosges, Paris.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1605,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Place des Vosges, Paris","name":"General view","start_year":1605,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/zzzarchi/17c/2/02f_1602.jpg"},{"artworkid":814,"author":"STEEN, Jan","description":"\n\n","end_year":1660,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on panel, 63 x 51 cm","museum_name":"The Hermitage, St. Petersburg","name":"The Doctor's Visit","start_year":1660,"type":"genre","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/s/steen/page1/doctorsv.jpg"},{"artworkid":818,"author":"BARKER, Thomas Jones","description":"\r\nThe Siege of Lucknow was the prolonged defence of the Residency within the city of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

The building is one of the well-known images of the early Modern Movement, with its classical cornice and plain frieze above plain wall surfaces and an asymmetrical arrangement of windows that reflected the free planning of the spaces within.\r\nLoos was very adamant about the pure form of the cube above all, and decoration is kept to a bare minimum. The walls are a stark white, and the windows frames contain the least amount of structure. This, however, is balanced by the frieze and cornice that runs along the top of the building, and a replica of some portions of the Parthenon frieze, positioned on the street side low enough for viewing. The frieze and cornice tie together the entire building while still contributing to the austere nature, seeming almost invisible.\r\nAnother key part of the Rufer house is the seemingly random arrangement of windows.

Shortly after its founding the confraternity began the construction of the church and oratory next door. The completion of the church was delayed until 1553. By around 1536, on the other hand, the oratory had been completed to the extent that the painted decoration of the room could begin.\r\nThe subject chosen for the fresco cycle, which covers the upper half of all four walls, was the story of the patron saint of the brotherhood, John the Baptist. For the execution of the cycle they selected Florentine (or Tuscan) artists working in Rome at the time. The most renowned Florentine painter active in Rome was Perino del Vaga, and several preparatory drawings for the frescoes by him have been preserved.

Devils of all species, human and grotesque, arrive from all directions by land, water and air, to converge upon a ruined tomb in the centre. On a platform before the tomb, an elegantly dressed pair have set up a table from which they dispense drink to their companions. Near by, a woman wearing a large headdress and a gown with an extravagantly long train kneels at a parapet to offer a bowl to a figure opposite. Kneeling beside her, almost unnoticed in the midst of this hellish activity, is St Anthony himself; he turns towards the viewer, his right hand raised in blessing. His gesture is echoed by Christ half-hidden in the depths of the tomb, which Anthony has converted into a chapel. The right wall of the sanctuary ends in a decaying tower covered with monochrome scenes. Two of them, the Adoration of the Golden Calf and a group of men making offerings to an enthroned ape, are images of idolatry, while the third, the Israelites returning from Canaan with a bunch of grapes, prefigures Christ carrying the Cross on the outer wings of the triptych.\r\nA burning village illuminates the dusky background, probably a reference to the disease of ergotism or \"St Anthony's Fire\", whose victims invoked the name of St Anthony for relief. The ancient association of ergotism with the devil-plagued saint may have been influenced by the fact that one phase of the disease is characterized by hallucinations in which the sufferer believes that he is attacked by wild beasts or demons.\r\nThe devils who have gathered around St Anthony display a complexity of form unusual even for Bosch. In the group far right, for example, a blasted tree trunk becomes the bonnet, torso and arms of a woman whose body terminates in a scaly lizard tail; she holds a baby and is mounted on a giant rat. Near by, a jug has been transformed into another beast of burden whose wholly unsubstantial rider bears a thistle for a head. In the water below, a man has been absorbed into the interior of a gondola-fish, his hands thrust helplessly through its sides. An armoured demon with a horse's skull for a head plays a lute at lower left; he sits astride a plucked goose who wears shoes and whose neck ends in a sheep's muzzle. All these shifting forms, moreover, display a richness of colour that confers a visual beauty on even the most disgusting shape. A recent, careful cleaning of the triptych, among Bosch's best preserved works, reveals brilliant reds and greens alternating with subtly modulated passages of blue-greys and browns.\r\nThis convocation of fiends ostensibly illustrates the second attack on Anthony described in the literary accounts; the miraculous light which dispersed the devils on this occasion can be seen shining through one of the chapel windows. But the devils do not seem about to scatter \"like dust in the wind\", as one version has it, nor are they physically attacking Anthony. Instead, their torments must be understood in a spiritual sense. Like the monstrous creatures who confront Deguilleville's pilgrim, they are incarnations of the sinful urges with which Anthony wrestled in his desert solitude. In a drawing made around 1500, Albrecht Dürer similarly illustrated the evil thoughts of a group of people at Mass by means of little devils fluttering about their heads. A number of sins symbolized by Bosch's monsters can be identified, chief among which is Lust. Lust is also represented more overtly in the group of buildings at extreme right, where a monk and a prostitute drink together within a tent; there may be a further reference in the dark-skinned devil in the central group: the demon of unchastity, we are told, once appeared to Anthony in the form of a black boy. It should not be surprising that even the most ascetic saints were susceptible to this particular vice: as the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" informs us, it was through the carnal act that the Devil could most easily assail mankind.\r\nAnthony, however, has overcome all his temptations through the strength of his faith. This faith is expressed in his gesture of benediction, thought to be particularly efficacious against the Devil; and the steady gaze which the hermit directs towards us is one of comforting assurance. While the wings of the Lisbon triptych show Anthony tempted and tormented, the central panel thus shows him triumphant.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1506,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on panel, 131 x 119 cm","museum_name":"Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon","name":"Triptych of Temptation of St Anthony (central panel)","start_year":1505,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/b/bosch/90anthon/central/01centr.jpg"},{"artworkid":876,"author":"BENONI, Giuseppe","description":"\r\nThe Dogana da Mar is at the point of confluence of the Giudecca Canal and the Grand Canal.

His mother Mary, father Joseph, various angels and the shepherds stand around him in adoration. In the background, the previous moment in the narrative sequence, when the angel announces the birth of the Saviour, is depicted in the surrounding scenery. The continuity of the background landscape erases the division between the central image and the side panels, where the family who commissioned the work is shown in prayer under the protection of four saints. To the left, Thomas the Apostle and St Anthony the Great preside over the head of family Tommaso Portinari and his two sons Antonio and Pigello, while to the right St Margaret, victorious on the dragon which had swallowed her, and Mary Magdalen, holding a vial of unguent, stand watch over Maria Baroncelli Portinari and her daughter Margherita. The different proportions of the saints and the members of the family reflect their position in social and religious hierarchy.\r\nOriginating from Florence, Tommaso Portinari (1428-1501) lived in Bruges for many years where he worked as a representative of the bank of the Medici family. In 1470 he married Maria Baroncelli, also of Florence; the family is depicted with clothing and hairstyles that reflect the Flemish fashion of the time. During his time in Flanders, Tommaso Portinari commissioned Flemish painter Hugo van der Goes to paint the Adoration of the Shepherds Triptych to adorn the Portinari family chapel in the church of Saint Giles in the Santa Maria Nuova hospital in Florence. The painting's arrival in Florence in 1483, having first reached Pisa by sea, was quite an event; the work was perceived to be extraordinarily innovative in the eyes of the Florentine painters, who particularly praised the realistic likeness of the objects, landscape and facial features. The still-life imagery in the central foreground is astonishing and abounds with symbolic references: the white iris and red lily allude to the theme of purity and Jesus's blood spilled during the Passion of the Christ, the purple columbine represents the sorrow of the Virgin Mary, while the carnations symbolize the Holy Trinity.\r\nWhen closed, the triptych showed a depiction of the Annunciation, painted in black and white on the verso of the doors.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1479,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on wood, 274 x 652 cm","museum_name":"Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence","name":"Portinari Triptych (open)","start_year":1476,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/g/goes/portinar/0portina.jpg"},{"artworkid":888,"author":"TIZIANO Vecellio","description":"\n\n","end_year":1514,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas","museum_name":"Alte Pinakothek, Munich","name":"Holy Family and Donor","start_year":1513,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/t/tiziano/01_1510s/09holyfa.jpg"},{"artworkid":892,"author":"LOO, Jacob van","description":"\n\n","end_year":-1,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on panel, 42 x 54 cm","museum_name":"Private collection","name":"Lot and his Daughters","start_year":-1,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/l/loo/jacob/lotdaugh.jpg"},{"artworkid":896,"author":"LANDSEER, Charles","description":"\r\nCinderella is European folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression.

Only relatively seldom do we see the twin-towered fronts so common in France. In their place English cathedrals and monastery churches were content with a simple straight façade, or else they competed with each other in the construction of lengthy showpiece fronts, the so-called screen façades. Such a façade is only indirectly connected with the nave opening up behind it. The façade extends across the whole building, and the towers are either set back at the sides, or rise up from just behind the wall of the façade.\r\nWest-end portals play no particularly noteworthy role in English architecture. In contrast to French portals, they cower insignificantly in the lower areas of the façade and are not decorated with sculpture. One reason for this is that the main entrances to English churches lay at the side, mostly on the north, where a lavishly decorated porch marks the portal.\r\nThe most beautiful English screen façade is to be found at Wells. The towers stand at the side of the nave and boldly protruding buttresses divide the building vertically. Several rows of blind arcading, one above the other, run across horizontally. Statues are spread over the whole façade, they consist of reliefs on the surfaces of the spandrels, life-size figures of saints on the buttresses and enthroned above them all, Christ presiding over the Last Judgment.\r\nThe photo shows the west front of the cathedral.

He and his pupils and assistants produced altarpieces and numerous smaller works for private devotion. One of his chief patrons was the Augustinian nunnery of Mariënpoel just north of Leiden. Among the works he made for the convent church were altarpieces with the Lamentation (c. 1508) and the Crucifixion (c. 1517), which were described by Karel van Mander in 1604 and are now in Leiden's Museum de Lakenhal.\r\nThe Amsterdam painting undoubtedly comes from an altarpiece illustrating episodes from the life of the Virgin. It was recognised as Engelbrechtsz.'s work in 1904, and shortly afterwards the Rijksmuseum was able to acquire a second, less well-preserved panel from the same altarpiece: Christ in the House of Martha and Mary.\r\nThe events depicted in the two panels are not found in the Bible but in the popular late-medieval Meditationes vitae Christi. Both scenes precede the Arrest of Christ. In the conversation with his mother and Mary Magdalen, Christ refused to abandon his planned visit to Jerusalem during the Jewish Passover, and foretold his impending death.\r\nThe second panel shows Christ taking leave of his mother, immediately before he and his disciples set off for Jerusalem. Movingly he embraces the kneeling Virgin amidst the sorrowful Marys and the apostles. Some of the disciples are descending into the valley on the right, with the city gate and walls of Jerusalem in the distance.\r\nThe attribution of the panels to Engelbrechtsz., based partly on the correspondences in style, colouring and manner of execution with the Crucifixion triptych in Leiden, was recently confirmed by an examination of the two underdrawings using infrared reflectography. \r\nThis painting is a fine example of the artist's more mature work. The poses and gestures in the figure group highlight the emotional nature of the leave-taking. The landscape and city in the background are painted in a surprisingly lively way. The steely, blue-white shapes of the mountains and rock formations contrast with the warm, bright colouring of the figures in the foreground. The attention paid to ornamental details, which was relatively slight by the standards of the day, and the broad manner of painting, which fades to the sketchy in the background, are typical of the work of Engelbrechtsz. and of the Leiden painters he trained.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1515,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on panel, 55 x 43 cm","museum_name":"Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam","name":"Christ Taking Leave of his Mother","start_year":1515,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/e/engelbre/christ_t.jpg"},{"artworkid":891,"author":"DEGAS, Edgar","description":"\r\nIn his early scenes from the theatrical world, Degas depicted only that which the audience or musicians could see of the stage. However, later he went backstage, and he became a cool observer of rehearsals. In his paintings the stage changed from being an incidental setting of the picture to become the theme of the picture itself. Following his works showing the rehearsal room and the stage as a whole (even when only a corner is depicted), there came his series of astounding variations on the theme of dancers, in groups or isolated, in which the artist gained more and more freedom of vision, forever changing angles and capturing the ballerinas in the most surprising positions. The dancers are painted more and more in close-up. They do not move within a well-defined three-dimensional space, they fill the foreground with colours against the wings and curtains.\r\nThe most remarkable among these works are the different versions of Ballerina with a Bouquet, Curtsying.

However, doubts are still being voiced about a possible collaboration with a specialist in still-life painting.

The handling of light is full of contrast, with ample use of white lead on the rosy skin standing out against the very dark green of the surroundings.\r\nVarious characteristics in the manner of painting and the style, as well as the conception, enable us to ascribe this hitherto unknown panel to the Master of the Legend of St Lucy. The stiff, marionette-like figures with heavily drawn features; the hard, richly contrasted palette; and the systematic use in his landscapes of stereotypical vegetation and towers or city views in the distance are typical of nearly all his compositions.\r\nIn this St Sebastian all these elements are clearly visible. The physiognomy with the heavy nose and the rather oriental eyes with large, vaulted upper eyelids and bushy eyebrows is to be seen in several of his works, for example, the Lamentation in Minneapolis and in the Tallinn altarpiece. The flat folds of the loincloth can be compared with the Virgin's head-scarf in the Lamentation of the Thyssen Foundation, where Christ's torso has been modelled in much the same way. The manner in which the vegetation is treated is almost identical in the St John on Patmos of Rotterdam and in the Legend of St Lucy in St James' Church in Bruges.\r\nOwing to its small format, it can be suspected that the St Sebastian was the wing of a triptych.

The patroness of the college, the lady-in-waiting Doña María de Córdoba y Aragón, had died back in 1593, implying that the commission likely came from her executor. The retable, like many other works in possession of the Church, was disassembled into its component parts during the French occupation of Spain. All we know from the surviving written sources is that El Greco supplied a total of seven paintings. This Annunciation in the Prado is one of these paintings, and it is an especially good example of the daring palette that characterizes the entire series.\r\nAt the bottom of the canvas, the terrestrial world is barely indicated by the steps, sewing basket and rose-bush in flame. The flames are rendered so naturalistically that they probably have appeared to mirror the real candle flames burning on the altar during the celebration of the Mass.

Dürer may well have painted it in the summer of 1489, at the age of 18, although it could date from 1494 after his journeyman travels. Inscribed `Saint John's Church', it shows the church and a row of houses which lay just to the west of Nuremberg. Nearly 40 years later Dürer was to be buried in Saint John's graveyard. Dürer's watercolour view faces south, with a view of the distant hills beyond. The perspective is curious; it is almost a bird's-eye view. The row of houses appears flat rather than three-dimensional. Despite these problems, Dürer has lavished great care on the picture. In his early watercolours he was more concerned about the rendering of detail, rather than the overall effect.\r\nThe watercolour of Saint John's Church was looted during the Second World War and lost for nearly 50 years. Owned by the Kunsthalle in Bremen, it was among thousands of Old Master drawings which had been hidden for safekeeping in the cellar of a mansion 50 miles north-west of Berlin. The Red Army occupied the house in 1945 and soldiers ransacked the art works. Viktor Baldin, a young officer, found this watercolour on the floor, among a mass of works abandoned by the first looters. He saved the picture, along with 363 other drawings (including 22 Dürers), and brought it back to Russia. Baldin later gave the drawings to the architectural museum near Moscow where he worked. The existence of the missing Bremen pictures was kept secret until 1992.

Active in Mantua and Padua (though he cannot be identified with the monk and prophet of the same name [1437-1531], as was once thought), his work reveals the influence of Mantegna together with some elements drawn from Ferrarese painting. It is characterized by a care for detail, perhaps exaggerated, and by miniaturistic tendencies in a Northern European manner that find expression in a crystalline and metallic linearity. The angular, skeletal landscape, bathed in a leaden light and ruthlessly cleared so that it looks devastated, creates a sense of anguish in its snapshot-like fixity, as if the events were taking place in a human terrarium from which all the air has been evacuated.\r\nThere are three panels in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj illustrating the life of St Anthony Abbot (251-356), the founder of monasticism, as recounted in the fourth century in St Athanasius's popular book. The first (not shown here) illustrates how Anthony, after the death of his parents and at the age of between eighteen and twenty, \"sold... all the other goods and chattels he possessed and distributed the large sum of money he obtained to the poor.\" The second panel (not shown here) is devoted to the temptations of the saint. Finally, in the third piece of the predella (shown in the reproduction), the great and terrible power of Evil is revealed with the worst characteristics of the human race, in all its innate repulsiveness and horrifying folly. Exorcisers appear on the rock, in the form of skulls, and Satan is transformed into malign shapes and ferocious beasts, however, a ray of light descends toward Anthony and a voice declares: \"I was here, Anthony, but I wished to see your struggle, and since you have withstood and have not been defeated, I shall always succour you\". This is the moral of the cycle. We do not know whether it is complete or whether other elements are missing, such as the leave-taking of his sister, the erotic visions, or the meeting with Paul.\r\nThe Temptations of Saint Anthony, a theme that has fascinated artists from Bosch to Grünewald, Schongauer, and Flaubert, is cited as the work of Mantegna in the fideicommissary list of 1819, while it was recorded, along with the other two parts, in an inventory of the palace in Piazza Navona drawn up on the death of Camillo Pamphilj in 1666.\r\nBecause of their style the three pictures by Parenzano can be dated to the same period as the Paduan frescoes in Santa Giustinia, painted around 1494 (the painter lived in the monastery, 1492-96). It is interesting to think that these Temptations set amidst arid ground, surrounded by chimeras and monsters, may have been painted in the same year as the discovery of the \"New World.\"\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1494,"genre":"painting","materials":"Panel, 46,4 x 58,2 cm","museum_name":"Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Rome","name":"Temptations of St Anthony","start_year":1494,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/p/parenzan/temptati.jpg"},{"artworkid":918,"author":"RAGGI, Antonio","description":"\r\nThe decoration of the Chigi Chapel was designed by Bernini.

Forsaking the bird's eye perspective, they view the scene from a lower and closer angle, as illustrated by the drawing A Forest Pool, by Antwerp artist Paul Bril, who worked in Rome from 1582 onwards. The emphasis is on the splendour of the wood and the majesty of the treetops. The little figure of the hunter is swallowed up in the surrounding, overwhelming nature and remains a secondary element in the composition. The trees are drawn decoratively with visible roots and knotty branches, invoked by nervous parallel strokes and curly little lines.\r\nOver this delicately drawn structure the artist applies a very subtle brown and grey wash tint, which stands out freshly against the areas of the paper that have been left white. The result is a playful interplay of light and dark right across the scene, gradually leading the eye towards the background. This technique reveals Bril's interest in light, the effect of which on the surroundings he carefully observes. This interest is also seen in the detailed representation of the reflection of the trees on the water. Although the viewer has direct access to this enchanting piece of woodland via the path leading from the very bottom of the picture, the highly refined style of drawing and the artificial structuring give the impression more of an ideal décor outside the confines of time and space.\r\nThis drawing belongs to a group produced between 1595 and 1600, all depicting intimate woodland surroundings. Jan Brueghel the Elder also treated this subject between 1592 and 1594 during his stay in Rome, where he met Paul Bril. Both artists drew inspiration from the woodland scenes of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Hans Bol and the Italians Titian and Girolamo Muziano. Bril's landscapes were very influential and were regularly printed, among others by Aegidius Sadeler. However, no corresponding print is known of A Forest Pool, that was conceived first of all as an autonomous work of art, though Bril did use it later as an aide-mémoire in producing the tree parts in a number of paintings.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1600,"genre":"graphics","materials":"Drawing on paper, 201 x 270 mm","museum_name":"Muses Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels","name":"A Forest Pool","start_year":1595,"type":"study","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/b/bril/paul/forestpo.jpg"},{"artworkid":901,"author":"LOISEAU, Gustave","description":"\r\nLoiseau was a self-taught painter who experimented with pointillism around 1884.

These paintings inspired several ceiling designs 'all'antica' in the first part of the sixteenth century. The desire to revive not only the forms of ancient Roman architecture but also their decoration may help to explain the success of these paintings. In particular, Raphael and the specialist in his workshop, who mastered the genre completely, helped the grotesque style to spread quickly in Rome. This style enjoyed a long-lasting success, which can still be demonstrated even after mid-century. Nevertheless, quite early on the genre developed independently and distanced itself increasingly from ancient models. Later grotesques differed from antique iconography in every respect and retain only the principle of an absurd and paradoxical combination of varied buildings, figures, animals, and plants that Vitruvius criticized.\r\nThe fresco decoration in the Rocca dei Rossi is an example of the later grotesques. Rocca dei Rossi is a castle located in San Secondo Parmense, northern Italy. It was begun in 1466 on land donated to Giacomo Rossi, a member of one of the most prestigious families in Parma.

The first stone was placed on April 18, 1506. The project's site had to be cleared first of the old, crumbling Basilica of Constantine. Bramante's part in its demolition earned him the nicknames of \"Maestro Ruinante\" or \"Master Wrecker.\" At the time of his death the new construction had scarcely begun to take shape.\r\nBramante's design, which was preferred to proposals submitted by Giuliano da Sangallo and Fra Giocondo, is represented on Caradosso's foundation medal (1506; e.g. National Gallery of Art, Washington), and the same design, apart from some minor deviations of detail, is recorded in a half-plan drawing known as the Parchment Plan (1A, Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence). The layout seems to have grown out of the ideas he had considered at Pavia Cathedral and Santa Maria delle Grazie, namely a domed Greek cross inscribed within a square and with apses on the main axes. It is here further elaborated with four subsidiary domes on the diagonals, where the Greek-cross arrangement is repeated on a smaller scale, and with four corner towers. The centre of the design corresponds fittingly with the revered tomb of St Peter, and the multi-domed layout recalls that of earlier sepulchral churches, such as San Marco, Venice. The arrangement of the crossing is a major innovation in church design, with diagonal chamfers to the massive crossing piers giving the dome a much greater diameter than the width of the arms.\r\nIn its enormous scale, Bramante's design for St Peter's was quite without precedent for a post-medieval church and relied heavily on ancient Roman bath complexes, which seem to have inspired a wholly new approach to spatial planning. Whereas during the 15th century internal spaces were conceived as a product of designing walls, in St Peter's the walls were a product of designing spaces. Through this new approach, greatly aided by Bramante's revival of Roman brick-and-concrete construction, the massive vault-bearing walls took up the residual areas between neighbouring spaces and were hollowed out in a multitude of alcoves, arches and niches.\r\nBramante's design for the dome, with its colonnaded drum resembling a circular temple and its crowning lantern, is known also from a plate in Serlio (Book III). In shape (hemispherical on the inside, stepped and dishlike on the outside) as well as in size, the design abandoned contemporary practice and was closely modelled instead on the Pantheon. The much greater overall size of St Peter's, however, compared with the Pantheon, was no doubt regarded as emblematic of the triumph of Christianity over ancient paganism and of the authority of papal rule.\r\nThe Parchment Plan design was, nevertheless, just one of many alternatives considered even as construction progressed. No decision seems to have been made by Bramante's death, however, even though the crossing had been substantially completed up to the height of the drum, with piers and attached Corinthian pilasters using capitals copied from those inside the Pantheon.\r\nThe picture shows Bramante's plan for the dome. You can also view Bramante's design of the ground plan for St Peter's.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1506,"genre":"graphics","materials":"Drawing","museum_name":"Museo Petriano, Vatican, Rome","name":"Plans for New St Peter's in Rome","start_year":1506,"type":"study","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/b/bramante/1archite/2/stpeters.jpg"},{"artworkid":977,"author":"STEEN, Jan","description":"\r\nThe reader is a self portrait.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1660,"genre":"painting","materials":"Oil on canvas","museum_name":"Szpmvszeti Mzeum, Budapest","name":"A Merry Party (detail)","start_year":1660,"type":"genre","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/s/steen/page2/m_party1.jpg"},{"artworkid":981,"author":"CARRIER-BELLEUSE, Albert-Ernest","description":"\n\n","end_year":-1,"genre":"sculpture","materials":"Bronze, red-brown patina, height 88 cm","museum_name":"Private collection","name":"Psyche","start_year":-1,"type":"mythological","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/c/carrier/psyche.jpg"},{"artworkid":985,"author":"GIAMBOLOGNA","description":"\r\nThis is one of the few drawings that have been persuasively assigned to Giambologna.

A key event for his development was his meeting the Bavarian crown prince, the future King Ludwig I, who lived in Rome. Ludwig commissioned Rottmann to paint the Italian Cycle in the Munich Hofgarten Arcades (1830-1833), a series of frescoes depicting Italian landscapes, which would remain a favourite subject.\r\nAnother major work was the Greek Cycle, based on studies made during a visit to Greece in 1834-1835 and destined for the Neue Pinakothek in Munich. These were done in encaustic (a technique employing heated wax colours that fused after application), and Rottmann worked on them until his death.

In the interior the similarities are obvious. the cathedral of Salamanca has been constructed throughout with groin vaults; it also boasts the mighty, pointed transverse arches in the nave. They form a particularly prominent sculptural feature in the interior because of an extra respond. Powerful, cruciform-based clustered piers rise from round bases and project so far into the nave that they almost seem to obstruct it.\r\nThe photo shows the chancel and the \"Torre del Gallo\" seen from the south-east.\r\nView the ground plan of the Cathedral of Salamanca.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1200,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Old Cathedral, Salamanca","name":"Exterior view","start_year":1150,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/zzzarchi/12c/5/17s_1152.jpg"},{"artworkid":1000,"author":"BCKLIN, Arnold","description":"\r\nBöcklin's patron Marie Berna commissioned this painting in 1880 as a memorial to her late husband.

Böcklin later wrote to her, \"you will be able to dream yourself into the world of dark shadows.\" Between 1883 and 1886, he painted three additional versions of the subject, each slightly different.

The church was built to commemorate a miracle that took place on one of the slopes surrounding the city, and thus Antonio had a site in the midst of a magnificent landscape with no preexisting constructions.\r\nAntonio's most important work is the pilgrimage church of the Madonna di San Biagio (begun 1518). The dome was completed in 1543, the east tower in 1564, and the west tower (not completed) was added in 1574. The lantern and the upper floor of the tower were designed in 1543 by Baccio d'Agnolo.\r\nAntonio's numerous drawings of the project (Florence, Uffizi) are evidence of a careful process of planning. Taking the model of his brother's Santa Maria delle Carceri, Prato, as a starting-point, he created a vast centralized building. The plan is a Greek cross, without aisles. A square block projects above the crossing to form a base for the drum, pilastered inside and out, which supports a hemispherical dome. The arms of the cross are barrel-vaulted, and the four supporting arches at the crossing spring from a jutting entablature borne on ensembles of deeply modelled Doric pilasters and engaged columns on a low plinth, which project well forward into the crossing space.\r\nThe church is designed into its landscape setting and, while enhancing the significance of its site, defers to the ambient buildings. The church, on which he worked from 1518 until his death in 1534, was the most ambitious church building of the period with the exception of St. Peter's in Rome.\r\nView the ground plan and section of the church.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1534,"genre":"architecture","materials":"Photo","museum_name":"Madonna di San Biagio, Montepulciano","name":"General view","start_year":1518,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/s/sangallo/antonio1/montepu1.jpg"},{"artworkid":993,"author":"MASTER M S","description":"\r\nThe detail shows Elizabeth kissing the hand of Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1506,"genre":"painting","materials":"Tempera on limewood","museum_name":"Magyar Nemzeti Galria, Budapest","name":"The Visitation (detail)","start_year":1506,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/m/master/ms/1visita2.jpg"},{"artworkid":997,"author":"POLLACK, Mihly","description":"\r\nThe Hungarian National Museum traces its foundation to 1802 when Count Ferenc Széchényi set up the National Széchényi Library.

The lying effigy rests on a low bed whose flanks are illustrated with Virtues reliefs.\r\nDiego de Siloé began his career as an associate of Bartolomé Ordóñez and probably worked with him in Italy. By 1519 he had returned to Burgos, where he remained until 1528. His most notable sculptures of this period include the tomb of Bishop Luis de Acuña (1519-20), a Man of Sorrows for the St Anne altarpiece of (1523), a section of the Presentation in the Temple, part of the main altarpiece in the Capilla del Condestable, executed in collaboration with Felipe Vigarny (1523-25), and the wall tomb of Canon Diego de Santander, all in Burgos Cathedral, as well as some free-standing sculptures: Christ at the Column (Diocesan Museum of the Cathedral, Burgos; another at Dueñas, S Agustín, La Visitación), St Sebastian in Barbadillo de Herreros (Burgos, La Visitación), and St Michael (Sasamón, S María la Real). The emphasis on the physical beauty of the sacred figures, the study of anatomy, his use of the proportions for the human body based on the canon of eight heads, and the exploration of expression and movement are innovative characteristics, which show the influence of Italian Renaissance sculpture; they are attributed to the impact of Michelangelo, whose work Siloé no doubt studied in Italy.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1520,"genre":"sculpture","materials":"Alabaster","museum_name":"Capilla Santa Ana, Cathedral, Burgos","name":"Tomb of Bishop Luis de Acua","start_year":1519,"type":"religious","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/s/siloe/diego/sculptur/acuna.jpg"},{"artworkid":999,"author":"KNOX, Archibald","description":"\r\nThe box, designed by Archibald Knox, was manufactured for Liberty & Co. by W. H. Haseler Ltd., London. This firm acted in partnership with Liberty & Co. for the manufacture of the Cymric range of silverware.\r\nDuring the late 19th century, archaeological investigations and discoveries contributed to regionalist and nationalist impulses in the decorative arts, such as the so-called \"Viking Revival\" style, rife with Scandinavian forms. Manx designer Archibald Knox often paired ornament inspired by the traditional arts of his Celtic ancestors with stylistic conventions of contemporary design movements. This box, enlivened by Celtic-inspired interlaced knots and enamelled buds characteristic of the English Arts and Crafts movement, captures the dual senses of historicism and modernity that defined turn-of-the-century design.\r\nThis box is one of four variants known to exist. The Museum's example is the most elaborate of the four and is distinguished from the other known examples by its bulging lid and massive opal cabochon. The complexity and scale of this work suggest it was made on special order and was among the more costly works in Liberty & Co.'s Cymric line of silver goods.\r\n\r\n\n","end_year":1905,"genre":"metalwork","materials":"Silver, enamel, and opal, 14 x 16 x 26 cm","museum_name":"Museum of Art, Dallas","name":"Box (model 652 variant)","start_year":1905,"type":"other","url":"https://www.wga.hu/detail/k/knox/1metal4.jpg"}]
